<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Just maybe, a <em>miracle </em>can happen twice. That’s what <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/calvin-harris/"  >Calvin Harris</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ellie-goulding/"  >Ellie Goulding</a> will be hoping, as “Miracle” (via Columbia) leads the <a  href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart-update/"  rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  >U.K. chart race</a> for what would be a second week at No. 1.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The throwback rave tune <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/calvin-harris-ellie-goulding-miracle-no-1-uk-1235299451/"  >last Friday</a> (April 7) climbed to the summit for the first time, a feat that saw Harris pass Elton John and Eminem on the list of artists with the most U.K. leaders (11), taking eighth place.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Goulding, meanwhile, equals Rita Ora and Geri Halliwell’s four No. 1s by a British female solo artist, and stands to snag a relatively rare chart double, should her new LP <em>Higher Than Heaven</em> <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/ellie-goulding-midweek-uk-chart-double-1235301537/"  >debut atop the albums chart</a>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Miracle” holds at No. 1 on the Official Chart Update, ahead of “People” (5k) by Afrobeats star <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/libianca/"  >Libianca</a>, which is set to rise 4-2, for what would be its peak position. <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ed-sheeran/"  >Ed Sheeran</a>’s former leader “Eyes Closed” (Atlantic) is on track to complete the podium, holding at No. 3. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Based on midweek sales and streaming data published by the Official Charts Company, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/drake/"  >Drake</a> is on course for the highest new entry with “Search &amp; Rescue” (OVO/Republic Records). It’s new at No. 7 on the chart blast. If “Search &amp; Rescue” holds its spot, the Canadian hip-hop star would earn a 38th U.K. top 10 single. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Also set for a top 40 splash is <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/david-guetta/"  >David Guetta</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/anne-marie/"  >Anne-Marie</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/coi-leray/"  >Coi Leray</a>’s “Baby Don’t Hurt” (Parlophone). The EDM cut, a reimagining of Haddaway’s 1993 number “What Is Love,” is new at No. 25 on the chart blast.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	And finally, U.S. country star <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/morgan-wallen/"  >Morgan Wallen</a> is eyeing his first ever U.K. top 40 single with “Last Night” (EMI). The track, lifting from Wallen’s Billboard 200 chart champion <em>One Thing At a Time</em>, is on track for a No. 40 bow.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	All will be revealed when the Official U.K. Singles Chart is published late Friday (April 14). <br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Billboard China will be the exclusive media partner for the competition.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Tencent Music Entertainment Group, the leading online music and audio entertainment platform in China, announced that its QQ Music has launched the global original music competition <em>THE ONE</em>, and global music media brand Billboard China will be the exclusive media partner for this competition.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The competition has invited talented singers, songwriters and musicians around the world including TIA RAY, Lenka and Greyson Chance to act as <em>THE ONE</em> ambassadors for the competition, together auditioning new original celebrities. <em>THE ONE</em> aims to continue to help talented Chinese musicians and high-quality original songs to go abroad and convey the voice of China to the world.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Based on this cooperation, TME will integrate its leading technology, profound industrial and user insights, comprehensive service systems in the Chinese music industry with global resources, influence and international high standards to provide talented musicians with a full range of services from the first demo recordings to the release of songs, as well as global promotion and customized performances, which will support Chinese stars on the world stage in all aspects.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>THE ONE</em> competition will be segmented into three major competition units &#8212; “Musical Work,” “Fresh Face” and “Label,” for songwriters, emerging musicians and quality labels, respectively &#8212; to provide a fair stage for competition and communication among different types of players with different audition mechanisms. Among them, the “Musical Work” unit will gather works from all over the world through TME’s Qimingxing Music Assistant, while at the same time invite famous Chinese original musicians such as Bird Zhang, L.T. and Ma SiWei, Mikey Jiao and Chen Zhuoxuan to participate. The “Fresh Face” unit will be strategically combined with Tencent Musician Platform’s New Forces project to identify excellent artists in the new generation, while the “Label” unit will collect original music works from high-quality labels globally, introducing independent labels valuing the quality of music creation and the diversity of music styles into the world’s spotlight, and bringing more &#8220;Chinese treasures&#8221; to global music fans.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The competition will eventually select and produce a conceptual music collection of THE ONE. The collection will be distributed globally through TME Music Cloud, including but not limited to overseas channels such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and others. The collection will also receive massive promotional traffic support and core resources from TME’s various platforms including QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music and Tencent Musician Platform, as well as being featured on the Billboard China master song list Golden Ears. In addition, honorees will also have the opportunity to participate in a special collaborative performance with Billboard Live in Shanghai, representing China&#8217;s high-quality original force on the global stage to bring exciting performances to music fans around the world.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	With this partnership, TME will continue to strengthen its in-depth collaboration with more music industry partners, bringing more quality original works and exciting performances to music lovers around the world. TME will continue the exploration of value patterns for the construction of Chinese music’s global influence, supporting and accompanying the birth and bloom of high-quality original Chinese music.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The band just released <em>SID 20th Anniversary BOX</em>, a 15-CD set that covers the band's history.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	This year, SID celebrated their 20th anniversary.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The four-piece band, made up of Mao (vocals), Shinji (guitar), Aki (bass) and Yuuya (drums), released their first album, <em>Renai</em>, in 2004. In 2008, they made their major-label debut on Sony Music with the opening theme song to the TV anime <em>Kuroshitsuji (Black Butler)</em>. Since then, they have regularly released albums and performed solo dome and stadium shows, establishing a solid career. However, due to health issues affecting Mao, the band stopped performing live in January 2022. A year later, this January, the band returned to the stage with an exclusive live show for members of their official fan club, a momentous start to their milestone 20th year.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	&#8220;It was a really moving show. I think I&#8217;ll remember it for the rest of my life, because it allowed me to see our fans again after the pandemic and after struggling with my own health problems,&#8221; said Mao. &#8220;It felt like I&#8217;d faced two tremendous challenges at the same time. That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t want to look back, but instead to make sure that 10 or 20 years from now, if I looked back, I&#8217;d feel that I&#8217;d made the best use of those experiences. I hope that our fans also understood that during that time when we were apart, we&#8217;d been working hard and looking to the future.&#8221; Shinji added, &#8220;Despite how much time had passed, the groove we got into as a band was really fun. The way the drums and bass intertwined was better than ever, and then the guitar, which played over the top, had tremendous freedom, so playing was a blast. In songs like &#8216;Toge To Neko,&#8217; the rhythm section really gets into a groove, so the guitar can do whatever it wants. It felt like I really went into my own world.&#8221;</p>

<div class="embed-youtube"><iframe loading="lazy" title="シド 『嘘』Music Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eglYGbybkrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Some of the members of the band have also been actively pursuing solo projects at the same time. Aki, SID&#8217;s songwriter and bassist, also performs vocals and writes the lyrics for his solo project. &#8220;During the time when SID wasn&#8217;t performing live, each of us was going in our own individual directions, but we were all continuing our music activities, and we all came back to where we belonged. I can&#8217;t pull the wool over our fans&#8217; eyes, or their ears, so even during that gap, I polished my own skills because I knew that when I came back to SID, I&#8217;d need to perform better than ever. Otherwise I&#8217;d be putting the cart before the horse. I hope our fans were able to see the fruits of those efforts in SID&#8217;s January solo show.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In April, SID will begin touring in support of their latest album, the long-awaited <em>Umibe</em>. Yuuya talked about his hopes for the tour. &#8220;We released <em>Umibe</em> a year ago. It&#8217;s unusual to go on tour for an album that fans have had so much time to really listen to. That&#8217;s why at our shows, we&#8217;ll need to go above and beyond simply playing the music. What&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s looking like the audience won&#8217;t be required to stay quiet during the show, so it&#8217;ll be a true return to form. Maybe starting the <em>Umibe</em> tour in April of this year was the best possible outcome all along. What we once took for granted has become a rarity, so that newfound freedom will make the show even more moving and powerful.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In commemoration of SID&#8217;s 20th anniversary, the band has released the <em>SID 20th Anniversary BOX</em>, a 15 CD complete boxed compilation set that covers the band&#8217;s entire history. In addition to all of SID&#8217;s albums, from <em>Renai</em> to <em>Umibe</em>, it also includes the <em>Side A complete collection</em> CD of title track singles that don&#8217;t appear on any of their albums and the <em>Side B complete collection</em> CD of B-sides they have released since their major label debut. The boxed set also contains a Blu-ray disc with 40 music videos, a booklet with the lyrics to all of their songs, and more. The <em>SID 20th Anniversary BOX </em>lives up to its name, commemorating the band&#8217;s efforts through the years.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Mao talked about how the box set came to be. &#8220;What led to the decision is that we and the staff were talking about how it would be great if there were a box set that would let our fans look back and remember all of the different things we&#8217;ve released. CDs no longer sell well, so our team thought really hard about what kind of value we could add to CDs. I think we&#8217;ve come up with something pretty wonderful.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	So, looking back on SID&#8217;s 20 year history, what do the members see as having been the band&#8217;s turning points? &#8220;One of the things that immediately leaps to mind is our first album, <em>Renai</em>,&#8221; said Shinji. &#8220;We had so little time, we were rethinking melodies while on the train. Thinking back on it, I&#8217;m impressed by what we were able to achieve. It had a really homemade feel to it, but that&#8217;s what made it so priceless. You can really feel the blood, sweat, and tears we poured into it. Every time we make an album, we pack it with what we want to do as a band, but that comes across particularly strongly with our first album.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Yuuya looked back on the band&#8217;s 15th anniversary, five years ago. &#8220;On our [My Favorite Place] tour, which we began right before our major label debut, we visited music clubs around the country, which is where we began as a band. We created a mini-album named <em>My Favorite Place</em> to share the message that these music clubs would always be special to us. We took a hiatus in 2016, too, but that just brought us even closer together when we released our fifth album, <em>NOMAD</em>, in 2017. The year after that was our 15th anniversary, and we really wanted to express our gratitude to our fans.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Aki called SID&#8217;s newest album, <em>Umibe</em>, a turning point for the band. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been making music for 20 years, and I feel like we&#8217;ve gone beyond just brushing up our sound to also reflecting a certain humanity in our songs. We&#8217;re not so much striving to make the &#8216;perfect&#8217; song, but instead to make songs that convey who we are. We don&#8217;t play along with a click track, but instead with each other, creating a live sound that could only come from us. It&#8217;s a more human, warmer sound.&#8221; It&#8217;s as if SID itself has become a living, breathing thing. &#8220;For example, in songwriting, sound arrangement is, to some extent, affected by modern trends. That&#8217;s not bad in and of itself. However, we&#8217;re now able to create sound arrangements that reflect who we are &#8212; that share the essence of SID. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what our future albums will be like.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="embed-youtube"><iframe loading="lazy" title="シド 『レイン』Music Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GB3DN7B4mx4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	When SID first started, it was praised for its sound style, which infused rock with the essence of Japanese kayokyoku, the progenitor to modern J-pop. However, the band eventually stopped using this approach and began exploring a greater diversity of sounds. I asked them if they ever felt worried about sealing off their own individuality or strengths. &#8220;Not really. From the start, SID&#8217;s been a band in which each member brings their own musical tastes to the table, so we&#8217;ve created what came naturally based on how we felt at the time.&#8221; However, Mao also points out that they weren&#8217;t afraid of stagnating, either. &#8220;For example, up until about our second album, <em>Hoshi No Miyako</em>, we were really trying to become popular as a four-piece band, playing in clubs, but after we released our third album, <em>play</em>, we began a tour of larger performance halls. Our staff created sets and staging appropriate for large venues, and we realized just how much support our staff was providing. Them, and our audience. A good live performance isn&#8217;t something that you can create through your own efforts alone. It&#8217;s something that happens when you&#8217;ve also got great staff and great fans. I feel like this is something we were able to experience because of how we changed as a band, so I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve kept evolving.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Having celebrated its 20th anniversary, SID is now beginning the next stage of its history. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll continue to keep up with trends while at the same time pursuing our own originality,&#8221; said Yuuya. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to put into simple words, but we&#8217;re in an age where we get direct feedback from our fans through social media, so I hope we can align the &#8216;SID-like&#8217; elements our fans want with our own sense of what SID is all about to create a single, unified whole.&#8221; Mao continued, &#8220;The songs we wrote when we were young have a certain quality that can only come from youth, but on the flip side, I&#8217;ve been singing for twenty years, so there are songs that can only be performed by the me of today, songs that my younger self wouldn&#8217;t have been able to pull off. The same is true for lyrics. I want to be able to write deeper, more profound lyrics. Until now, I&#8217;ve drawn on my own stockpile of ideas to write lyrics that are packed with a sense of curiosity, but in the future I want to become a lyricist who can write more naturally, crafting lyrics that share my way of thinking and living. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m always exposing myself to different types of music, film, and books, travelling, and enriching myself as a human being.&#8221; However, he continued, &#8220;I hope we&#8217;ll keep playing together for years to come, so I hope all four of us continue to enjoy good health and keep on having fun.&#8221;</p>

	Coming at No. 2 on the latest all-genres albums survey is <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/melanie-martinez/"  >Melanie Martinez</a>&#8216;s <em>Portals</em> (Atlantic). That’s a career-best for the U.S. alternative-pop artist, following her 2015 debut <em>Cry Baby </em>(No. 32 peak) and 2019&#8217;s <em>K-12</em> (No. 8).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Australian indie-rock trio <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/dmas/"  >DMA’S</a> has been dreaming of a high chart bow with <em>How Many Dreams? </em>(via I Oh You/Mushroom), which had tracked for a No. 3 berth on <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/boygenius-midweek-chart-the-record-1235297122/"  >the midweek chart</a>. <em>Dreams</em> completes the chart race in third position, a career-best for the Sydney band &#8212; Tommy O’Dell, Matt Mason and Johnny Took &#8212; following the No. 4 peak for its predecessor, 2020’s <em>The Glow</em>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Following the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/de-la-soul-lathums-slowthai-uk-midweek-albums-chart-1235280906/"  >long-overdue </a>release of <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/de-la-soul/"  >De La Soul</a>’s catalog on DSPs, the hip-hop pioneers’ 1989 debut <em>3 Feet High and Rising </em>(Chrysalis) hits a new peak, some 34 years after its original release. <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em> rises to No. 9, its first appearance in the top 10, thanks to a reissue campaign on vinyl, CD and cassette. Last month, as it hit streaming platforms, the set vaulted to a <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/the-lathums-uk-no-1-nothing-to-a-little-bit-more-1235284899/"  >then-best of No. 12</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Closing out the top 10 is <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/davido/"  >Davido</a>, with his fourth studio set<em> Timeless </em>(Ceremony of Roses). It’s the Nigerian singer-songwriter’s first top 10 appearance on the U.K. chart. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Finally, Odd Future rapper, singer and songwriter <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/tyler-the-creator/"  >Tyler, the Creator</a> returns to the top 20 with his 2021 effort <em>Call Me If You Get Lost</em> (Columbia), which benefits from the deluxe reissue treatment. <em>Call Me</em> rings in at No. 18. <br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding’s throwback rave tune climbs 3-1, for its first stint at the summit.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	A dance music <em>miracle</em> has seized the U.K. singles chart.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Four weeks into its chart journey, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/calvin-harris/"  >Calvin Harris</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ellie-goulding/"  >Ellie Goulding</a>’s throwback rave tune &#8220;Miracle (via Colombia) climbs 3-1, for its <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/"  target="_blank"  >first stint at the summit</a>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	With its unlikely climb, Harris now boasts an 11th U.K. No. 1 and Goulding a fourth. Also, it’s their first as a duo, and third top 10 after 2012’s “Need Your Love” (No. 4 peak) and 2014’s “Outside” (No. 6). &#8220;Miracle&#8221; led at the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/calvin-harris-ellie-goulding-miracle-uk-midweek-1235297762/"  >midweek stage</a> and completes the chart race in top spot. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The last time Harris checked in at the chart penthouse was 2018 with “Promises,” featuring Sam Smith, while Goulding last scaled the chart in December 2019 with the English singer’s cover of Joni Mitchell’s “River.” </p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	According to the Official Charts Company, Harris, the Scottish EDM DJ and producer, now moves into eighth place in the all-time list of artists with No. 1s, pulling away from Eminem and Elton John (with 10 each). </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Goulding, meanwhile, draws level with Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora among British female solo artist leaders. Just two artists are above her on the list, the OCC reports: Jess Glynne (seven No. 1s) and former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl (five).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The Official U.K. Singles Chart podium is completed by two former leaders, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/miley-cyrus/"  >Miley Cyrus</a>’s “Flowers” (Columbia), unchanged at No. 2; and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ed-sheeran/"  >Ed Sheeran</a>’s “Eyes Closed” (Atlantic), down 3-1.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Further down the list, rising pop star <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/mimi-webb/"  >Mimi Webb’s</a> “Red Flags” (Epic) lifts 13-12, its equal peak position. “Red Flags” is the top trending song in the U.K. right now, the OCC reports. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The highest new entry on the latest chart, published April 7, belongs to <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/blackpink/"  >BlackPink</a> singer <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/jisoo/"  >Jisoo</a>, with her debut solo single “Flower” (Interscope).

					<description><![CDATA[Frontman/gutarist &#38; principal songwriter Kazu-umi Kumagai, bassist Taiyu Ishikawa and drummer Takuya Hirose spoke with Billboard Japan about their new set.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	After coming back from their first world tour last year, Japan’s BURNOUT SYNDROMES recently dropped <em>The World Is Mine</em>, a collection of songs featured as the themes of various popular anime series such as <em>Haikyu!!</em> and <em>Dr. Stone</em>. The album includes tracks that blend Japanese and Western influences, for example the title track from the band’s indie days rearranged in a Western style, the English version of &#8220;FLY HIGH!!,” a collaborative number with FLOW called “I Don&#8217;t Wanna Die in the Paradise,” and &#8220;Mt. Wakakusa Starmine,” a song featuring traditional Japanese instruments renamed from the original Japanese title that means the same.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The three members of the band — frontman/gutarist and principal songwriter Kazu-umi Kumagai, bassist Taiyu Ishikawa, and drummer Takuya Hirose — spoke with Billboard Japan about their new set and elaborated on the kind of music they hope to share with their international audiences through these anime themes and live performances. They also chatted about what they’ve gained from their overseas treks and their current place as a band.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>Your new album is characterized by its clear focus on global expansion, as the title, </strong><strong><em>The World is Mine</em></strong><strong>, unambiguously describes. Your first live performance outside of Japan was in 2017 in France. Why did you set your sights on the world at this current time?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kazu-umi Kumagai: What we experienced in 2022 was a huge factor in realizing that I wanted us to<strong> </strong>go global. Starting from September, we played outside of Japan once every month.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Takuya Hirose: I think the reason why so many music festivals outside of Japan have reached out to us is because the number of people watching Japanese anime has increased globally as a result of the pandemic. Anime can be watched in just over 20 minutes each, unlike drama series and movies, so that probably fit with the times, too.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Taiyu Ishikawa: In fact, around the summer of 2020 we saw an huge influx of subscribers to our YouTube channel, and the number of monthly listeners on Spotify began to exceed a million. When I was in Japan, it didn&#8217;t feel like so many people were listening to our stuff, but it really hit home when we played overseas. In that sense, I think the fact that we’re in demand overseas has been reflected in the numbers for some time.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: From an international perspective, Japan equals anime. The Riyadh Season 2022 event in Saudi Arabia where we performed last year was like an Expo featuring representative cultures from around the world, like bullfighting for Spain, King Kong for the U.S., and Shibuya and anime for Japan. Part of the reason for that was because the royal family of Saudi Arabia likes Japanese games and anime, but it seemed like no matter which country we visited, the impression people have of Japan is anime. It’s like Hollywood for the U.S. from our point of view, or soccer for Argentina.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>That analogy really makes sense.</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: So the local audiences tend to be more in interested in artists linked to lots of anime theme songs. But we were told by a local agent that it’s rare for an act to be invited to perform overseas so much, even considering how many anime themes they’ve done. I guess there must be something about our music that strikes a chord with people everywhere.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>I get what you’re saying, because BURNOUT SYNDROMES has been pursuing a musical style not limited to rock from the beginning.</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: Anime themes tend to lean towards rock songs, but I’ve always been the type that wants to do music that isn’t limited by the framework of a rock band, like tracks using traditional Japanese instruments or inspired by EDM. I think our music is being welcomed outside of Japan because we have such songs, and we’re able to compete on a global level with our sound and not necessarily because of the content of the lyrics. That’s something I sense during our live shows overseas.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>You say that, but the lyrics are also a distinctive quality of BURNOUT SYNDROMES. Kazu-umi’s (Kumagai) narrative lyrics have been acclaimed since the band’s indie days, and for example, there’s a line in the FLOW collab &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Wanna Die in the Paradise&#8221; that goes, &#8220;I want to be world famous,” expressing strong determination and fighting spirit.</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Ishikawa: We’ve both always loved Kumagai&#8217;s lyrics.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Hirose: I think every time, “The lyrics are so good again!” [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: For &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Wanna Die in the Paradise,&#8221; (the five-man band) FLOW and our band wanted to combine the elements that we consider to be the current styles in Western music with J-pop-like distortion guitar to come up with a number that we could present to the world as something born from our backgrounds. After I began to actually travel abroad, the way I see my home country has been changing. So for a while from here, I feel like I’ll be in a period of judging whether I should incorporate Western elements into a song or if sticking with J-pop ways is better, case by case. It’s fun because I’m gradually beginning to discern that. I&#8217;m hoping we can bring together the best of both worlds.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Hirose: At the Crunchyroll EXPO 2022 in the U.S., we did a set that mainly featured songs with traditional Japanese instruments, like (the original) &#8220;Mt. Wakakusa Starmine” and &#8220;Hanaichimonme,” and the local audience seemed to love it. It was nice to know that people enjoyed the sounds of traditional instruments and also our songs not connected to any anime works.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Ishikawa: Our band has a lot of songs not limited to rock, so when we say stuff to hype up the crowd during our shows like Western DJs do, it works really well. I think that’s why we can play in front of crowds in any country pretty smoothly.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>Listening to your latest collection, it feels like the songs released within the last four or five years are the ones that have clearly evolved beyond the basic rock band format. Was there a reason why you decided to change so much?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: The rise of Billy Eilish. She really made me feel, &#8220;Whoa, we really can’t keep doing what we’ve been doing.” The sound of each instrument in a rock band is so strong that you have to sing really loud to get your voice across, but her vocals don’t do that. That was a culture shock for me, and I also thought it was so cool. So I wanted to fuse together the best parts of a rock band and music that layers a narrow range of sounds like hers.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Ishikawa: When I play such songs onstage, I really feel that a single note played live can create a groove. I think that’s the good thing about being in a band.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Hirose: Another good thing about playing in a band is that you can connect songs by maintaining the tension of the moment.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: Like they both said, notes played live is the best part of a concert. But if you do that in a recording, it turns out sounding like a regular rock band. That’s why for the past few years, we’ve been recording BURNOUT SYNDROMES’s songs by thinking of combinations like if live drums are used, the bass will be synths, or if the bass is live, the drums will be computerized.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>Hearing you speak, I got the sense that “the fusion of opposites” is the concept that describes where BURNOUT SYNDROMES is at the moment. For example, &#8220;the world and Japan&#8221; and “computer and instrumental sounds.”</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: I’ve never intentionally done things thinking, “Lemme fuse this and that.” I’ve just been trying to let go of my habits all this time.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Ishikawa: Kumagai does things differently each time. So there are moments when I think, “What’s my real job?” and I have to learn something new each time. [<em>Laughs</em>]&nbsp;But I really enjoy that, too.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Hirose: Other drummers I know say to me, “You always have to do new things and it seems like a lot of work.” [<em>Laughs</em>] But I really enjoy those moments when I successfully pull off a difficult beat, and I also love it when I can go all out on tracks like &#8220;Hanaichimonme” upon Kumagai’s request.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai:&nbsp; We’ve been trying to create things that have never been done before, to include beats and sounds that we’ve never tried before. When we write music for anime, we study the works and try the ideas we come up with. We’ve faced each work carefully and have given everything we had at the time. It feels like the results of these efforts have led us to where we are now.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>You said you try to let go of your habits. That’s like saying you’re letting go of the band’s essence, or character. Is there anything you’re unwilling to concede?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: Well&#8230; After doing so many different things, the one thing our songs have in common is that Kazu-umi Kumagai is singing them. I have a kind of weird voice that gets drowned out in rock music. I’ve been grappling with this for a long time and began experimenting with various ways to make my voice heard in our songs. So it was this voice that led me to try out new things with our sound.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>That explains why you were drawn to the way Billie Eilish sings without raising her voice. So BURNOUT SYNDROMES’s music evolved because of Kazu-umi Kumagai’s vocals.</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: That&#8217;s also the story behind the title track of the new album, which is a&nbsp; rearrangement of the original “The World is Mine.” I’d wanted to do a new arrangement for that track for a while and decided to include it this time because it happened to fit the theme of the collection. Thinking about the sound we create with this rather imperfect voice and how to make it resonate beautifully is what this band has been about, I guess.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>The chorus of &#8220;FLY HIGH!!” also has elements of this. It has an explosive, instantly unforgettable melody. The opener for </strong><strong><em>Haikyu!!</em></strong><strong>&nbsp; Season 2 continues to enjoy a huge international following, and it’s the track that kicked off BURNOUT SYNDROMES’s collaborations with anime.</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: I think that song comes across that way because we were able to create the rhythm with a three-note refrain. For a long time, I’ve been thinking hard about how to place rhythm and refrain in the melody so the band can compete with this voice. I naturally began placing importance on rhythm, and I guess that turned out to suit international listeners. We want people outside of Japan to listen to our music the way Japanese people listen to Western music. (To make that happen,) it has to be music that can be enjoyed even if you can’t understand the lyrics. We included the English version of &#8220;FLY HIGH!!” in our new album, so I hope people enjoy it in a different way when they find out what it’s about.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>Did you expect “FLY HIGH!!” to become so popular when you first wrote it?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: Not at all. It was my first time writing a theme for an anime series, and I just did my best. But (music producer) Junji Ishiwatari once said to me that a debut song is really important, so while I was writing it I was sure it’d become a song that I’d sing for the rest of my life. It’s a number that I wrote with that kind of determination.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Hirose: “Hikariare” and &#8220;PHOENIX&#8221; were also featured as <em>Haikyu!! </em>themes after &#8220;FLY HIGH!!,” so lots of people probably think <em>Haikyu!! </em>when they hear BURNOUT SYNDROMES. &nbsp; <em>Haikyu!! </em>is an important work that<em> </em>helped us meet all kinds of people.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Ishikawa: I’ve always loved the original manga series and <em>Haikyu!!</em> is like my textbook for life. Whenever I take on a challenge, I read it over again to inspire myself. I’m really proud to be able to play with such an important work on my shoulders.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>A band that’s been singing about “the world&#8221; is now breaking out on the global stage. That’s pretty dramatic.</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION is probably why I often use the words “sekai” (world in Japanese) and &#8220;world&#8221; in my lyrics. I came across that band when I was in elementary school and &#8220;world&#8221; was input in my mind as a word that sounded cool in most contexts. [<em>Laughs</em>] I find it interesting that we’re being invited to places around the world almost 20 years later. We currently have three routes available to us: being heard in the Japanese market, being invited around the world through our anime collabs, and being heard by the fans of artists we collaborate with, so I’d like to write songs accordingly.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>BURNOUT SYNDROMES has carved out an unprecedented path in the Japanese band scene, and will continue to blaze the trail it looks like.</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Hirose: I like Kumagai&#8217;s songs. That’s the reason why I’ve been in this band all this time. So as long as this continues into the future, I don&#8217;t care how we do it or where, in Japan or elsewhere.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Ishikawa: Speaking of unprecedented, I’ve been trying to spread the J-pop culture of raising your hand during the chorus of a song at our performances abroad. It&#8217;s not going so well. [<em>Laughs</em>] I want to communicate to people around the world how to enjoy our culture, and I also want to pursue ways to convey the beauty of the Japanese language and Kumagai&#8217;s lyrics.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Kumagai: Recently, I’ve been feeling that we’ve reached a new starting point again. It’s really hard to write songs that will be appreciated both in Japan and abroad, so I think it’s our job to pave the way for that with the help of anime. It might be unprecedented, but there’s no point in following what everyone else is doing&#8230; I mean, we’re a band that has released only such songs. [<em>Laughs</em>] We hope to continue doing worthwhile work.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/treasure/"  >TREASURE</a>’s “Here I Stand” takes the No. 1 spot on the latest <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/japan-hot-100/"  >Billboard Japan Hot 100</a>, dated April 5, tallying the week from March 27 to April 2.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The theme of the movie <em>Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King</em> came in at No. 2 for sales with 313,370 copies sold in its first week, while also hitting No. 17 for streaming with 4,484,777 weekly streams, No. 2 for radio, and No. 73 for downloads. Points from the first three metrics fueled the first single by the 10-member K-pop boy band to the top of the Japan Hot 100 this week, holding Nogizaka46’s new single at bay.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Nogizaka46’s “Hito wa yume wo nido miru” (“People Dream Twice”) sold 663,277 copies to rule sales this week, but couldn’t support this lead with other metrics: No. 12 for downloads, No. 26 for radio, and No. 78 for video views. The girl group’s 32rd single rises 56-2 on the Japan Hot 100.</p>

	Figure-wise, Nogizaka46’s previous single &#8220;Koko niwa nai mono” launched with 830,384 copies and the one before that sold 720,302 copies in its first week, showing a slight downward trend.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Yuuri’s new album <em>Ni</em> (“Two”) tops the Billboard Japan Hot Albums chart this week after coming in at No. 2 for sales and No. 1 for downloads. This has boosted some of his songs up the chart, namely “Billimillion,” which rises 15-8 to break into the top 10. The track broke out in streaming in particular, rising 12-4 for the metric with 5,958,767 streams, increasing by 22.8 percent from the previous week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Just 2,000 chart units separate the top three at the midweek stage. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Miracles do happen. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	After several weeks staring at the U.K. chart summit, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/calvin-harris/"  >Calvin Harris</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ellie-goulding/"  >Ellie Goulding</a>’s “Miracle” (Columbia) lifts into top spot on the <a  href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart-update/"  rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  >chart blast</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Miracle” leaps over <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/miley-cyrus/"  >Miley Cyrus</a>’ “Flowers” (Columbia), which holds at No. 2, and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ed-sheeran/"  >Ed Sheeran</a>’s “Eyes Closed” (Atlantic), down 1-3, to take top spot on the Official Chart Update. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	It&#8217;s tight at the top. According to the Official Charts Company, just 2,000 chart units separate the top three at the midweek stage. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In its three weeks on the chart, “Miracle” has never gone higher than No. 2, thanks to the 10-week unbroken reign by “Flowers,” which came to an end <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/ed-sheeran-eyes-closed-uk-chart-1235295914/"  >last Friday</a> (March 31).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	If it does capture the crown when the Official Chart is published late Friday (April 7), “Miracle” would give Harris his 11th No. 1, and first since “Promises” with Sam Smith in 2018; and Goulding her fourth U.K. chart leader. As a pair, Harris and Goulding previously landed hits with 2012’s “I Need Your Love” (peaking at No. 4) and 2014’s “Outside” (No. 6).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Miracle,” a throwback rave tune, enjoys a lift following the release of an official music video, and a new “Church Version” featuring Goulding’s vocals recorded in St. Bartholomew The Great, London&#8217;s oldest surviving church. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Further down the midweek list, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/jisoo/"  >Jisoo</a> is on track to become the first member of <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/blackpink/"  >BlackPink</a> to land a solo U.K. top 40 hit with “Flower” (Interscope). It’s new at No. 29 on the chart blast. With &#8220;Flower&#8221; and its <em>ME</em> two-pack, Jisoo became the last of her bandmates, after Rosé, Jennie and Lisa, to release <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/blackpink-jisoo-solo-debut-me-stream-flower-video-1235295765/"  >a solo project</a>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Finally, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/tyler-the-creator/"  >Tyler, The Creator</a> could nab a fourth top 40 with “Dogtooth” (Columbia). It’s new at No. 37 on the Chart Update.<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boygenius leads an all-new top three on the Official Chart Update. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/boygenius/"  >Boygenius</a> is bouncing to No. 1 on the U.K. chart with<em> The Record</em> (via Interscope), the indie supergroup’s debut LP.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Formed by Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus, Boygenius leads an all-new top three on the Official Chart Update, the U.K.&#8217;s midweek tally.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	If it holds its spot, <em>The Record</em> would give Bridgers her highest-charting U.K. LP, beating the No. 6 best for her 2020 record <em>Punisher</em>. Boygenius’ eponymously titled EP from 2018 didn&#8217;t trouble the Official U.K. Albums Chart.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Meanwhile, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/melanie-martinez/"  >Melanie Martinez</a> is on track for a career-best No. 2 with <em>Portals</em> (Atlantic), her third studio release. The U.S. alternative-pop act already has one U.K. top 10 to her name: 2019’s <em>K-12</em>, which peaked at No. 8. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Completing the podium on the <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart-update/"  target="_blank"  >Official Chart Update</a> is Australian indie-rock trio <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/dmas/"  >DMA’S</a>, with <em>How Many Dreams?</em> (I Oh You/Mushroom Group). Showcasing <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://themusicnetwork.com/dmas-dream-start-uk-chart/"  target="_blank"  >a reimagined</a> Britpop sound and swagger, DMA’S &#8212; comprising Tommy O’Dell, Matt Mason and Johnny Took &#8212; last cracked the top 10 with 2020’s <em>The Glow</em>, which peaked at No. 4. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Following a reissue across vinyl, CD and cassette formats, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/de-la-soul/"  >De La Soul</a>’s 1989 debut <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em> (Chrysalis) could return to the top 10, for a brand new peak. The set, which reenters at No. 4 on the chart update, recently rebounded to a current best No. 12 following the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/de-la-soul-lathums-slowthai-uk-midweek-albums-chart-1235280906/"  >long-overdue rollout</a> of the hip-hop pioneers’ catalog on streaming platforms.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Also new to the top 10 at the midweek stage is <em><a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-who/"  >The Who</a> With Orchestra – Live at Wembley </em>(Universal Music Recordings), a live recording from the British rock legends’ only U.K. date of their 2019 <em>Moving On Tour</em>. If it stays put, <em>Live at Wembley</em>, recorded with the 57-piece Isobel Griffiths Orchestra, will give Roger Daltrey and Co. their 16th U.K. top 10 album. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Finally, Nigerian singer and songwriter <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/davido/"  >Davido</a> is eyeing a career-best peak with his fourth studio album, <em>Timeless</em> (via Ceremony of Roses). It’s new at No. 8 on the chart blast.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	All will be revealed when the Official U.K. Albums Chart is published late Friday (April 7).<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/lana-del-rey/"  >Lana Del Rey</a> hits the U.K. albums chart for six with <em>Did you know that there&#8217;s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd</em> (via Polydor), the new leader. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Ocean Blvd</em> blasts to No. 1 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart, the fastest-selling LP of 2023 so-far, passing the opening week of Pink’s recent leader <em>Trustfall</em>, the Official Charts Company reports. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The U.S. alternative pop artist’s ninth studio album becomes her sixth leader, after <em>Born to Die</em> (from 2012), <em>Ultraviolence</em> (2014),<em> Lust for Life</em> (2017), <em>Norman F*cking Rockwell!</em> (2019) and <em>Chemtrails Over the Country Club</em> (2021). </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	According to the OCC, <em>Ocean Blvd</em> delivers Del Rey’s strongest first week in the U.K. since 2014’s <em>Ultraviolence</em>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	With her latest crown, Del Rey ranks fifth all-time among female solo artists with the most U.K. No. 1s. Only Madonna (with 12), Taylor Swift (9), Kylie Minogue (8) and Barbra Streisand (7) have more. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
