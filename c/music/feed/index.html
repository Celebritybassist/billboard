										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Recordings by <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/madonna/"  >Madonna</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/daddy-yankee/"  >Daddy Yankee</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/mariah-carey/"  >Mariah Carey</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/john-lennon/"  >John Lennon</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/led-zeppelin/"  >Led Zeppelin</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-police/"  >The Police</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/queen-latifah/"  >Queen Latifah</a> are among 25 being added to the National Recording Registry, the Library of Congress announced Wednesday (April 12).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The inductions include some history-makers. Daddy Yankee’s “Gasolina” is the first reggaeton recording to be inducted; the Super Mario Bros. theme (composed by Koji Kondo) is the first theme from a video game to join the registry; Lennon’s “Imagine” is the first recording by a former Beatle to be honored. The Beatles’ landmark 1967 album <em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> was inducted in 2003.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	This year’s inductions include three albums that topped the Billboard 200 – <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/crosby-stillsnash-young/"  >Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young</a>’s <em>Déjà vu</em> (1970), The Police’s <em>Synchronicity</em> (1983) and Madonna’s <em>Like a Virgin</em> (a 1984 release that topped the chart in 1985). <em>Synchronicity</em> was The Police’s only No. 1 album, <em>Déjà vu</em> was the first of three for CSNY, <em>Like a Virgin</em> was the first of nine for Madonna that made her the queen of pop.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	This year’s inductions include five songs that reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 – <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-four-seasons/"  >T</a><a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-four-seasons/"  >he Four Seasons</a>’ “Sherry” (1962), <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/bobbie-gentry/"  >Bobbie Gentry</a>’s “Ode to Billie Joe” (1967), <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/irene-cara/"  >Irene Cara</a>’s “Flashdance…What a Feeling” (1983), <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/eurythmics/"  >Eurythmics</a>’ “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” (1983), and Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” (a 1994 release that first topped the Hot 100 in 2019 and has returned to No. 1 every year since).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Four newly-inducted recordings reached the top 10 on the Hot 100, though they fell short of the top spot – Jackie DeShannon’s “What the World Needs Now Is Love” (No. 7 in 1965), <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/john-denver/"  >John Denver</a>’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads” (No. 2 in 1971), Lennon’s “Imagine” (No. 3 in 1971) and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/jimmy-buffett/"  >Jimmy Buffett</a>’s “Margaritaville” (No. 8 in 1977).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	These 25 recordings were deemed worthy of preservation “based on their cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation’s recorded sound heritage,” according to the Library of Congress. This brings the number of titles on the registry to 625. The latest selections were released between 1908 and 2012.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Several of these inductions are linked to creative figures who have recently died. Cara died on Nov. 25, followed by David Crosby of CSNY on Jan. 18; Burt Bacharach, the composer of “What the World Needs Now Is Love,” on Feb. 8; and Seymour Stein, who signed Madonna to his Sire Records imprint, on April 2. (Bacharach and lyricist Hal David received the Library’s Gershwin Prize for Popular Song award in 2012.)</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The induction of “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” is the third major accolade for <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/eurythmics/"  >Eurythmics</a> in the past year. In June 2022, Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. This year, they are scheduled to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The induction of the Super Mario Bros. theme is the latest sign of increased respect for video game music. The Recording Academy added a new category, best score soundtrack for video games and other interactive media, at the 65th annual Grammy Awards, which were presented on Feb. 5.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Four of these entries received Grammy nominations in marquee categories. <em>Déjà vu</em> and&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Synchronicity </em>both vied for album of the year; “Ode to Billie Joe” for record and song of the year; Cara’s “Flashdance…What a Feelin’” for record of the year. The latter smash also won an Oscar for best original song.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“All I Want for Christmas Is You” joins a short list of holiday perennials in the Registry. Others include Associated Glee Clubs of America’s 1925 recording of “Adeste Fideles,” Bing Crosby’s 1942 classic “White Christmas,” Eugene Ormandy’s 1959 album <em>Messiah</em>, Nat King Cole’s 1961 re-recording of The King Cole Trio’s 1946 classic “The Christmas Song,” The Vince Guaraldi Trio’s 1965 TV soundtrack, <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Latifah’s<em> All Hail the Queen</em> is just the second album by a female rapper to join the Registry, following Lauryn Hill’s <em>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</em>, which straddles the line between hip-hop and R&amp;B.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>All Hail the Queen</em> was Latifah’s debut album. <em>Déjà vu</em> was the first CSNY album. At the other extreme, <em>Synchronicity</em> was the final studio album by The Police before Sting left for a successful solo career.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/koko-taylor/"  >Koko Taylor</a>’s 1966 hit “Wang Dang Doodle” is the fifth recording by a female blues artist to be saluted, following Memphis Minnie’s “Me and My Chauffeur Blues,” Mamie Smith’s “Crazy Blues,” Bessie Smith’s “Down-Hearted Blues,” and Gertrude “Ma” Rainey’s “See See Rider Blues.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Led Zeppelin’s 1971 classic “Stairway to Heaven” became as famous as most No. 1 hits even though it was never released as a single. It was one of the first tracks to show the power of the album-oriented rock (AOR) format.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Déjà vu</em> showed the influence of Joni Mitchell, this year’s recipient of the Library’s Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Mitchell wrote “Woodstock,” which was the first and biggest hit from the album. Graham Nash, her live-in partner at the time, wrote “Our House,” a diary-like account of an average day at their home in California. Both songs became top 30 hits on the Hot 100.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Concerto for Clarinet and Chamber Orchestra” recorded by Northwest Chamber Orchestra, was released on CD in 2012, making it the most recently-released recording to make the Registry. The classical recording captures the shifting moods of Sept. 11, 2001, from the hustle and bustle of a normal working day in New York City to the violence, anger and sorrow that followed. WNYC’s radio broadcast for that historic day was inducted last year.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“The National Recording Registry preserves our history through recorded sound and<br>reflects our nation’s diverse culture,” Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said in a statement. “The national library is proud to help ensure these recordings are preserved for generations to come, and we welcome the public’s input on what songs, speeches, podcasts or recorded sounds we should preserve next. We received more than 1,100 public nominations this year for recordings to add to the registry.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Under the terms of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000, the Librarian of<br>Congress, with advice from the National Recording Preservation Board, selects 25 titles<br>each year that are “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” and are at least 10<br>years old.

					<description><![CDATA[The Rock And Roll Hall of Famers went large with a classic, “Holier Than Thou.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/metallica/"  >Metallica</a> are still thundering along, cranking it up and to 11 and inciting headbanging everywhere they go. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The Bay Area metal legends are currently locked in for a residency on<em> Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>, a celebration of their forthcoming 12th studio album, <em>72 Seasons</em>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On Tuesday (April 11), the second of their four-night stand, the Rock And Roll Hall of Famers went large with a classic, “Holier Than Thou,” lifted from their self-titled 1991 album, better known as <em>The Black Album</em>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	It was<em> The Black Album </em>that launched these monsters of rock into superstar territory, and saw them tagged as the most popular heavy band of them all. <em>Metallica</em> was the first of the awesome foursome&#8217;s six leaders on the Billboard 200 chart, logging four weeks at the summit. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	If you want your rock tight, meaty and your guitar solos shredded, “Holier Than Thou” is for you.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On opening night, James Hetfield and Co. sat for a chat with Kimmel and performed “Lux Æterna,” lifted from <em>72 Seasons</em>, due out this Friday (April 14). </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	When the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/metallica-kimmel-residency-night-one-stranger-things-lux-aeterna-1235300959/"  >conversation moved</a> to the now-iconic placement of “Master of Puppets” in a pivotal scene in season four of Netflix’s <em>Stranger Things</em>, Hetfield said it was a no-brainer, and that he’s still “blown away” that people are still turned on by the high-octane speed metal cut. “It’s like a nine-minute heavy metal song from 1986 that probably predates most of these people by 25 30 years,” drummer Lars Ulrich added. “It’s just insane. Who would have thought?”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Metallica will perform “Master of Puppets” on Wednesday (April 12), which Kimmel reckons is the longest song ever performed on the show.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">

					<description><![CDATA["Higher Than Heaven" and "Miracle" head the midweek surveys.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ellie-goulding/"  >Ellie Goulding</a> is eyeing a slice of heaven &#8212; a U.K. chart double. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The English singer and songwriter leads the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/calvin-harris-ellie-goulding-miracle-miwdeek-second-uk-chart-crown-1235300796/"  >midweek chart </a>for second week with “Miracle” (via Polydor), her throwback rave single with Calvin Harris, and her fifth studio set<em> Higher Than Heaven</em> heads-up the midweek albums survey. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	If <em>Higher Than Heaven </em>holds its spot, Goulding will boast a fourth leader following debut <em>Lights</em> (from 2010),<em> Halcyon</em> (2012) and <em>Brightest Blue</em> (2020). The only LP to miss out was 2015’s <em>Delirium</em>, which peaked at No. 3. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	New at No. 2 on the Official Chart Update is<em> Hope</em> (EMI), the sixth studio album from U.S. rapper, singer-songwriter and producer <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/nf/"  >NF</a>. If<em> Hope</em> hangs in there, it’ll give NF (real name: Nathan John Feuerstein) a career best following 2019’s <em>The Search</em> (No. 7) and 2021’s <em>Clouds</em> (No. 12). </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Following a 20th anniversary reissue of <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/linkin-park/"  >Linkin Park’s</a> sophomore album <em>Meteora</em> (Warner Records), the LP is about to fire back into the top 5, at No. 3. The former leader contains previously-unreleased material featuring vocals from the late Chester Bennington, who died in 2017, aged 41.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Another fresh title on track for a top 5 berth is Daughter&#8217;s <em>Stereo Mind Game</em> (4AD). It’s new at No. 4 on the midweek chart, for what would be the indie folk trio’s highest-charting album to date and first top 10, eclipsing their previously charting efforts <em>If You Leave </em>from 2013 (No. 16 peak) and 2016’s <em>Not to Disappear </em>(No. 17).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Just maybe, a <em>miracle </em>can happen twice. That’s what <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/calvin-harris/"  >Calvin Harris</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ellie-goulding/"  >Ellie Goulding</a> will be hoping, as “Miracle” (via Columbia) leads the <a  href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart-update/"  rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  >U.K. chart race</a> for what would be a second week at No. 1.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The throwback rave tune <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/calvin-harris-ellie-goulding-miracle-no-1-uk-1235299451/"  >last Friday</a> (April 7) climbed to the summit for the first time, a feat that saw Harris pass Elton John and Eminem on the list of artists with the most U.K. leaders (11), taking eighth place.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Goulding, meanwhile, equals Rita Ora and Geri Halliwell’s four No. 1s by a British female solo artist, and stands to snag a relatively rare chart double, should her new LP <em>Higher Than Heaven</em> <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/ellie-goulding-midweek-uk-chart-double-1235301537/"  >debut atop the albums chart</a>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Miracle” holds at No. 1 on the Official Chart Update, ahead of “People” (5k) by Afrobeats star <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/libianca/"  >Libianca</a>, which is set to rise 4-2, for what would be its peak position. <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ed-sheeran/"  >Ed Sheeran</a>’s former leader “Eyes Closed” (Atlantic) is on track to complete the podium, holding at No. 3. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Based on midweek sales and streaming data published by the Official Charts Company, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/drake/"  >Drake</a> is on course for the highest new entry with “Search &amp; Rescue” (OVO/Republic Records). It’s new at No. 7 on the chart blast. If “Search &amp; Rescue” holds its spot, the Canadian hip-hop star would earn a 38th U.K. top 10 single. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Also set for a top 40 splash is <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/david-guetta/"  >David Guetta</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/anne-marie/"  >Anne-Marie</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/coi-leray/"  >Coi Leray</a>’s “Baby Don’t Hurt” (Parlophone). The EDM cut, a reimagining of Haddaway’s 1993 number “What Is Love,” is new at No. 25 on the chart blast.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	And finally, U.S. country star <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/morgan-wallen/"  >Morgan Wallen</a> is eyeing his first ever U.K. top 40 single with “Last Night” (EMI). The track, lifting from Wallen’s Billboard 200 chart champion <em>One Thing At a Time</em>, is on track for a No. 40 bow.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	All will be revealed when the Official U.K. Singles Chart is published late Friday (April 14). <br></p>

	<a  rel="noreferrer noopener"  href="http://www.billboard.com/music/blackpink"  target="_blank"  >BLACKPINK</a> made music-festival history during their Coachella 2019 performance as the first female K-pop group to play at the iconic festival. Four years later, the quartet set a new standard entirely with a headlining slot at the Indio, Calif., fest.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Alongside <a  href="http://www.billboard.com/music/bad-bunny"  >Bad Bunny</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/frank-ocean/"  >Frank Ocean</a>, BLACKPINK reign as one of the three main headliners for Coachella 2023 and the main musical affair for day 2 of both festival weekends on Saturday, April 15 and 22. While 2019 saw the act less than three years into their journey together for their Coachella debut with two EPs, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/jennie"  >Jennie</a>&#8216;s <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/blackpink-jennie-solo-no-1-world-digital-song-sales-chart/"  >&#8220;Solo&#8221; debut</a> and a handful of singles, the BLACKPINK ladies now boast two full-length albums, solo music from each member and multiple world tours to draw on for experience.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Ahead of the meaningful moment this weekend, each BLACKPINK member reflected with&nbsp;<em>Billboard</em>&nbsp;about their first performance in 2019, their feelings about playing in the desert this time and more.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	While Jennie wowed with her group and &#8220;Solo&#8221; performances at Coachella in 2019, the singer-rapper says her anticipation of returning to the festival stage surpasses any butterflies.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	&#8220;We&#8217;re so excited and honored to be able to return to Coachella as headliners,&#8221; <em>The Idol</em> star says. &#8220;We had the best time in 2019 and can&#8217;t wait to experience the energy of the audience again. There are some nerves, but more than anything, we&#8217;re just ready to have fun.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/rose"  >Rosé</a> says she&#8217;s still coming to terms with the opportunity to come back as headliners but recalls how substantial their first performance was in fueling the quartet&#8217;s ambitions.</p>





<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	It feels absolutely unreal,&#8221; the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/blackpink-rose-gone-music-video-9551031/"  >&#8220;Gone&#8221; singer-songwriter</a> says. &#8220;I think performing for Coachella in 2019 was a moment that really woke us up as BLACKPINK—to be motivated, to dream on and dream big. But we never expected anything as big as being the headliner of a festival we&#8217;ve all grown up admiring and hoping someday we could find ourselves in the crowd of.&#8221;</p>

We try all the time to show a new side of ourselves for each stage to repay the love from BLINKs. It is an honor to perform as a headliner for Coachella festival; we want to show our improvement as BLACKPINK on stage — and will — so, stay tuned.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Despite the hundreds of thousands that attend Coachella, BLACKPINK&#8217;s youngest member <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/lisa/"  >Lisa</a> says she&#8217;s sticking to the group&#8217;s mantra when approaching any performance, including anything unique for this weekend.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	&#8220;Our motto is to enjoy every stage and moment, &#8216;as if it&#8217;s the last,&#8217; [by] interacting with the audience by energy and doing our best while performing,&#8221; the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lisa-blackpink-money-video-9634909/"  >&#8220;Money&#8221; superstar</a> says while <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/blackpink-as-if-its-your-last-third-no-1-world-digital-song-sales-chart/"  >referencing a beloved BLACKPINK single from 2017</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;re working hard on various performances for 2023 Coachella; look forward to it!&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	While Rosé also wants to keep the focus on simply returning to the stage, she and her band mates know they must meet the moment. &#8220;We&#8217;re honestly just excited to be back at Coachella performing, period, but the deal here is—we&#8217;re headlining,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;We feel honored for this opportunity as much as we feel the immense responsibility. We&#8217;ll be bringing something fun to the table.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/mariah-angeliq/"  >Mariah Angeliq</a> caught up with <em>Billboard News</em> to discuss the criticisms that inspired her latest single “Ricota,” running away from home to pursue music and how she thrives as a woman in reggaeton.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“I [grew up] listening to music because of my mom. She has a love for music and named me Mariah because Mariah Carey was her favorite artist,” she explains. “When I was like 9, I realized yeah, I wanna be on the screen. That could be me.” </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The Miami native has seen much success in a short time, including her breakout single “Perreito,” which she performed at <em>Billboard</em>’s 2022 Latin Music Week and later with the chart-topping “EL MAKINON” alongside Colombian star Karol G. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Mariah recalled meeting producer Nely “El Arma Secreta” at age 16 and was motivated by the Luny Tunes hitmaker to begin singing in Spanish. “For all my teenage years, I was singing in English and thinking to myself that I was going to be like the next fire R&amp;B American artist,“ she tells <em>Billboard</em>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Around that time, Mariah ran away from home to fully immerse herself in the pursuit of music, something she says her family didn’t take seriously early on. Despite the lack of enthusiasm from her loved ones, she pressed forward. “We always know as artists that we’re going to make it,” she says. “I always believed in myself, and in my music.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Her most recent single, “Ricota,” came in response to Internet “haters” hurling insults at the 23-year-old singer regarding her weight. “They started saying I was fat and I’m not here looking for validation. I think what that’s what the message of the song is,&#8221; Mariah explains. &#8220;Society has such a distorted perspective of beauty. But while I was getting all those negative comments, I received a DM saying that I was &#8216;<em>bien ricota</em>,&#8217; so I got inspired.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	When it comes to navigating reggaeton, which for most of its history has been male-dominated, she draws on inspirations like Ivy Queen and her own &#8220;boss&#8221; energy. “I feel like I’ve navigated or learned to navigate through it really well because of my attitude and my strong character. You just gotta learn to speak up for yourself and have a voice.” </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Mariah will embark on a European tour this summer, and possibly a U.S. tour to follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Tencent Music Entertainment Group, the leading online music and audio entertainment platform in China, announced that its QQ Music has launched the global original music competition <em>THE ONE</em>, and global music media brand Billboard China will be the exclusive media partner for this competition.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The competition has invited talented singers, songwriters and musicians around the world including TIA RAY, Lenka and Greyson Chance to act as <em>THE ONE</em> ambassadors for the competition, together auditioning new original celebrities. <em>THE ONE</em> aims to continue to help talented Chinese musicians and high-quality original songs to go abroad and convey the voice of China to the world.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Based on this cooperation, TME will integrate its leading technology, profound industrial and user insights, comprehensive service systems in the Chinese music industry with global resources, influence and international high standards to provide talented musicians with a full range of services from the first demo recordings to the release of songs, as well as global promotion and customized performances, which will support Chinese stars on the world stage in all aspects.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>THE ONE</em> competition will be segmented into three major competition units &#8212; “Musical Work,” “Fresh Face” and “Label,” for songwriters, emerging musicians and quality labels, respectively &#8212; to provide a fair stage for competition and communication among different types of players with different audition mechanisms. Among them, the “Musical Work” unit will gather works from all over the world through TME’s Qimingxing Music Assistant, while at the same time invite famous Chinese original musicians such as Bird Zhang, L.T. and Ma SiWei, Mikey Jiao and Chen Zhuoxuan to participate. The “Fresh Face” unit will be strategically combined with Tencent Musician Platform’s New Forces project to identify excellent artists in the new generation, while the “Label” unit will collect original music works from high-quality labels globally, introducing independent labels valuing the quality of music creation and the diversity of music styles into the world’s spotlight, and bringing more &#8220;Chinese treasures&#8221; to global music fans.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The competition will eventually select and produce a conceptual music collection of THE ONE. The collection will be distributed globally through TME Music Cloud, including but not limited to overseas channels such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and others. The collection will also receive massive promotional traffic support and core resources from TME’s various platforms including QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music and Tencent Musician Platform, as well as being featured on the Billboard China master song list Golden Ears. In addition, honorees will also have the opportunity to participate in a special collaborative performance with Billboard Live in Shanghai, representing China&#8217;s high-quality original force on the global stage to bring exciting performances to music fans around the world.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	With this partnership, TME will continue to strengthen its in-depth collaboration with more music industry partners, bringing more quality original works and exciting performances to music lovers around the world. TME will continue the exploration of value patterns for the construction of Chinese music’s global influence, supporting and accompanying the birth and bloom of high-quality original Chinese music.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“The relationship had just run its course. It’s why [Alwyn] hasn’t been spotted at any shows,” a source reportedly told <em>ET</em>.&nbsp;<em>Billboard</em>&nbsp;has since reached out to representatives for Swift and Alwyn, but had not received a response. The couple has yet to publicly reveal the status of their relationship.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Alwyn also worked with Swift on her albums under the pen name William Bowery, winning his first Grammy in 2021 as a co-producer of Swift’s album of the year winner,&nbsp;<em>Folklore</em>&nbsp;(along with Swift, Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On&nbsp;<em>Evermore</em>, Alwyn co-wrote “Champagne Problems,”&nbsp;<a  rel="noreferrer noopener"  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-national/"  target="_blank"  >The National</a>-assisted “Coney Island” and “Evermore.&#8221; And on Swift’s most recent release,&nbsp;<em>Midnights</em>, he contributed to “Sweet Nothing.”</p>
