					<description><![CDATA["Higher Than Heaven" and "Miracle" head the midweek surveys.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ellie-goulding/"  >Ellie Goulding</a> is eyeing a slice of heaven &#8212; a U.K. chart double. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The English singer and songwriter leads the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/calvin-harris-ellie-goulding-miracle-miwdeek-second-uk-chart-crown-1235300796/"  >midweek chart </a>for second week with “Miracle” (via Polydor), her throwback rave single with Calvin Harris, and her fifth studio set<em> Higher Than Heaven</em> heads-up the midweek albums survey. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	If <em>Higher Than Heaven </em>holds its spot, Goulding will boast a fourth leader following debut <em>Lights</em> (from 2010),<em> Halcyon</em> (2012) and <em>Brightest Blue</em> (2020). The only LP to miss out was 2015’s <em>Delirium</em>, which peaked at No. 3. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	New at No. 2 on the Official Chart Update is<em> Hope</em> (EMI), the sixth studio album from U.S. rapper, singer-songwriter and producer <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/nf/"  >NF</a>. If<em> Hope</em> hangs in there, it’ll give NF (real name: Nathan John Feuerstein) a career best following 2019’s <em>The Search</em> (No. 7) and 2021’s <em>Clouds</em> (No. 12). </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Following a 20th anniversary reissue of <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/linkin-park/"  >Linkin Park’s</a> sophomore album <em>Meteora</em> (Warner Records), the LP is about to fire back into the top 5, at No. 3. The former leader contains previously-unreleased material featuring vocals from the late Chester Bennington, who died in 2017, aged 41.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Another fresh title on track for a top 5 berth is Daughter&#8217;s <em>Stereo Mind Game</em> (4AD). It’s new at No. 4 on the midweek chart, for what would be the indie folk trio’s highest-charting album to date and first top 10, eclipsing their previously charting efforts <em>If You Leave </em>from 2013 (No. 16 peak) and 2016’s <em>Not to Disappear </em>(No. 17).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Finally, Scottish singer and songwriter <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/lewis-capaldi/"  >Lewis Capaldi </a>is enjoying a sales bump following the release of his Netflix documentary <em>How I’m Feeling Now</em> (EMI). His chart-topping 2019 debut <em>Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent</em> is set to lift 17-6.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	All will be revealed when the OCC publishes its weekly charts on Friday (April 14).<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Drake is on track for another top 10 appearance on the U.K. singles chart.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Just maybe, a <em>miracle </em>can happen twice. That’s what <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/calvin-harris/"  >Calvin Harris</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ellie-goulding/"  >Ellie Goulding</a> will be hoping, as “Miracle” (via Columbia) leads the <a  href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart-update/"  rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  >U.K. chart race</a> for what would be a second week at No. 1.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The throwback rave tune <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/calvin-harris-ellie-goulding-miracle-no-1-uk-1235299451/"  >last Friday</a> (April 7) climbed to the summit for the first time, a feat that saw Harris pass Elton John and Eminem on the list of artists with the most U.K. leaders (11), taking eighth place.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Goulding, meanwhile, equals Rita Ora and Geri Halliwell’s four No. 1s by a British female solo artist, and stands to snag a relatively rare chart double, should her new LP <em>Higher Than Heaven</em> <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/ellie-goulding-midweek-uk-chart-double-1235301537/"  >debut atop the albums chart</a>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Miracle” holds at No. 1 on the Official Chart Update, ahead of “People” (5k) by Afrobeats star <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/libianca/"  >Libianca</a>, which is set to rise 4-2, for what would be its peak position. <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ed-sheeran/"  >Ed Sheeran</a>’s former leader “Eyes Closed” (Atlantic) is on track to complete the podium, holding at No. 3. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Based on midweek sales and streaming data published by the Official Charts Company, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/drake/"  >Drake</a> is on course for the highest new entry with “Search &amp; Rescue” (OVO/Republic Records). It’s new at No. 7 on the chart blast. If “Search &amp; Rescue” holds its spot, the Canadian hip-hop star would earn a 38th U.K. top 10 single. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Also set for a top 40 splash is <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/david-guetta/"  >David Guetta</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/anne-marie/"  >Anne-Marie</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/coi-leray/"  >Coi Leray</a>’s “Baby Don’t Hurt” (Parlophone). The EDM cut, a reimagining of Haddaway’s 1993 number “What Is Love,” is new at No. 25 on the chart blast.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	And finally, U.S. country star <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/morgan-wallen/"  >Morgan Wallen</a> is eyeing his first ever U.K. top 40 single with “Last Night” (EMI). The track, lifting from Wallen’s Billboard 200 chart champion <em>One Thing At a Time</em>, is on track for a No. 40 bow.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	All will be revealed when the Official U.K. Singles Chart is published late Friday (April 14). <br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its 47-week trek to the summit marks a new record.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Singer-songwriter and producer <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/fred-jerkins/"  >Fred Jerkins</a>’ “I Believe,” featuring Bishop Paul S. Morton, reaches No. 1 on <em>Billboard</em>’s <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/gospel-airplay/"  >Gospel Airplay</a> chart (dated April 15).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The song, Jerkins’ third Gospel Airplay leader and Morton’s first, increased by 1% in plays March 31-April 6, according to Luminate.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The song was solely written and produced by Jerkins, who hails from Galloway, N.J.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“It feels so amazing to have achieved my third No. 1 as an artist on <em>Billboard</em>&#8216;s chart,” says Jerkins. “Also, being able to share this with a legend like Bishop Paul Morton makes it extra special for me.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Jerkins previously topped Gospel Airplay with “Patiently Praising,” for a week in January 2021, and “Victory,” featuring Last Call, for two frames in April 2019.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Morton’s first Gospel Airplay leader is among 11 appearances, starting in 2005. His lone additional top 10 is “Your Best Days Yet,” which reached No. 4 in 2013. (Also among his history on the chart: “Seasons Change,” with legend Aretha Franklin, hit No. 40 in 2005.)</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In addition to his career in music, Morton is the founding bishop of Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship International in Atlanta, as well as overseer of Greater St. Stephen Ministries in New Orleans.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Notably, with “I Believe” reaching the Gospel Airplay pinnacle in its 47th week, it completes the longest trip to No. 1 since the chart started in March 2005. It passes two songs that each took 46 weeks to the top: Jonathan McReynolds’ “Make Room” led for a week in December 2019 and Donnie McClurkin’s “I Need You” reigned for a week in April 2017.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>Maher’s Fourth Leader</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On <em>Billboard</em>’s Christian AC Airplay chart, Matt Maher scores his fourth No. 1 with “The Lord’s Prayer” (up 9% in plays).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Maher previously ruled with “Alive &amp; Breathing,” featuring Elle Limebear, for two weeks in July 2020; “Glory (Let There Be Peace),” for a week in January 2017; and “Because He Lives (Amen),” for four frames beginning in April 2015.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The collab hits No. 1 in its third week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/eslabon-armado/"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/artist/eslabon-armado/"  >Eslabon Armado</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/peso-pluma/"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/artist/peso-pluma/"  >Peso Pluma</a> celebrate a new win with their first partnership, “Ella Baila Sola,” as the song hits No. 1 on <em>Billboard</em>’s <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/latin-songs"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/charts/latin-songs"  >Hot Latin Songs</a> chart (rising 2-1 on the April 15-dated list). The achievement arrives after the song debuted at No. 1 on <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/latin-streaming-songs"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/charts/latin-streaming-songs"  >Latin Streaming Songs</a> and earned both acts career-highs on Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Latin Songs charts (dated April 1), until now.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“We didn’t expect for the song to make so much noise!” Pedro Tovar, lead singer for Eslabon, tells <em>Billboard</em>. “I really liked the song when I first wrote it, but I didn’t really expect it to be such a big hit. I previewed it on my stories on Instagram and two days after it went viral on TikTok and that’s when I knew that the song was going to do big numbers.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Ella Baila Sola” dances its way to the top with a 2-1 lift and evacuates Karol G and Shakira’s “TQG” from its five-week domination. It’s the first leader for both Eslabon Armado and Peso Pluma, who, as mentioned, previously claimed their highest ranking on Hot Latin Songs when the track debuted at No. 2 (chart dated April 1).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Normally I don’t expect to chart with songs,” Peso Pluma tells <em>Billboard</em>. “It is a great song, and we just enjoyed the process of doing it.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Ella Baila” traces its No. 1 arrival largely to 19 million official U.S. streams, up 22%, earned in the tracking week ending April 6, according to Luminate. The figure makes for a 12-6 lift on the overall Streaming Songs chart and a third week at the summit on <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/latin-streaming-songs"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/charts/latin-streaming-songs"  >Latin Streaming Songs</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Working with Peso Pluma is probably one of my best collabs,” Tovar adds. “He’s a super humble and chill guy, and we get along good in the studio. He invited us to his show in Ontario and it was amazing, everybody was singing the song. I really appreciate him hopping on the song, it benefited us both.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“I admire every artist I work with!” Pluma continues. “I’ve always wanted to collaborate with them along with other great artists I looked up to.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Ella Baila” also sold 1,000 downloads in the same tracking week, jumping 7-5 on <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/latin-digital-song-sales"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/charts/latin-digital-song-sales"  >Latin Digital Song Sales</a>. The song likewise makes progress on the all-genre <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/"  >Hot 100</a> tally, peaking at No. 17, earning both acts their highest rankings there.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On a global scale, “Ella” concurrently unlocks new highs on both <em>Billboard</em> Global lists: jumps 11-9 on <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-global-200/"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-global-200/"  >Global 200</a> with 67 million streams, while ascends 10-8 on <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-global-excl-us"  data-type="URL"  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-global-excl-us"  >Global Excl. U.S.</a> with 46 million clicks.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Further, Peso Pluma places a total of five simultaneous tracks on Hot Latin Songs as “PRC,” with Natanael Cano, pushes 11-7 on the current chart. With five total top 10 entries on the same week, he ties with Karol G who also placed five top 10s on the March 11-dated ranking. Only one other artist has placed more concurrent songs in the top 10: Bad Bunny registered 6, 7, 8, and 9, across different chart weeks.</p>

	In the series, the titular character appears in a dance sequence soundtracked by The Cramps’ 1981 single “Goo Goo Muck.” Fans took the clip to TikTok but replaced “Goo Goo Muck” with a sped-up version of “Bloody Mary,” which then went viral. Lady Gaga herself participated in the trend by re-creating the dance. The song’s sped-up mix was subsequently included in Netflix&#8217;s promo for <em>Wednesday</em>’s forthcoming <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/wednesday-season-2-confirm-trailer-lady-gaga-bloody-mary-1235195114/"  >second season</a>.</p>

	After debuting on Pop Airplay (Dec. 31, 2022), “Bloody Mary,” being promoted to top 40 radio by Interscope Records, completes a 16-week run up the chart to the top 10.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Here’s a rundown of Lady Gaga’s 14 Pop Airplay top 10s:</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Nearly 12 years after its May 2011 release, <em>Born This Way</em>, thus, generates its fourth Pop Airplay top 10, as “Bloody Mary” joins the title track, “The Edge of Glory” and “You and I.” Two other songs from the set reached the chart’s top 15 in 2011: second single “Judas” (No. 15) and fifth single “Marry the Night” (No. 14).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	To date, “Bloody Mary” has drawn 401 million in all-format radio airplay audience and 166 million official on-demand streams and sold 92,000 downloads in the United States, according to Luminate.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Bloody Mary” is among a wave of <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/old-songs-tiktok-new-hits/"  >older songs scoring new life</a>, likewise largely sparked by newfound virality on TikTok. Also in the latest Pop Airplay chart’s top 10, The Weeknd’s “Die for You,” from 2016 and recently remixed with Ariana Grande, ranks at No. 4, following two weeks at No. 1 in February, and Miguel’s “Sure Thing,” another song originally from 2011, jumps to No. 8 (up 25% in plays, good for the list’s Greatest Gainer award), becoming his first top 10 on the tally.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/blackpink/"  >BlackPink</a>’s <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/jisoo/"  >Jisoo</a> scores a slice of U.K. chart history, as her single “Flower” (via Interscope) enters the top 40 on debut. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	With the <em><a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/blackpink-jisoo-solo-debut-me-stream-flower-video-1235295765/"  >ME</a></em> cut arriving at No. 38 on the latest Official U.K. Singles Chart, published <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/"  target="_blank"  >April 7</a>, Jisoo becomes the first first member of the K-pop girl group to bag a <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/calvin-harris-ellie-goulding-miracle-no-1-uk-1235299451/"  >top tier solo hit</a>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Jisoo’s bandmates Rosé, Lisa and Jennie have tried. Rosé came closest, with her 2021 debut single “On the Ground” peaking at No. 42.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Thus far, BlackPink has landed eight U.K. top 40 singles: 2018 Dua Lipa collaboration “Kiss and Make Up” (No. 36 peak), 2019’s “Kill This Love” (No. 33), 2020&#8217;s “How You Like That” (No. 20), 2020 Selena Gomez collab “Ice Cream” (No. 39), 2020’s Lovesick Girls (No. 40), 2020’s Lady Gaga collab &#8220;Sour Candy&#8221; (No. 17), and 2022 singles “Pink Venom” (No. 22) and “Shut Down” (No. 24).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	BlackPink already made U.K. chart history when, in 2022, they became the first female K-pop group crowned on the all-genres albums chart with <em>Born Pink,</em> which roared to No. 1. The foursome’s debut <em>The Album </em>had peaked at No. 2 in 2020. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Flower” is blooming on charts around the world. It’s <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/miley-cyrus-flowers-jisoo-flower-global-charts-1235300430/"  >currently at No. 2</a> on the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated April 15), becoming the third member of BlackPink to have hit the top 10 on each chart after Rosé and Lisa. “Flower” makes the third-biggest streaming start for an artist’s proper debut focus track since the global charts originated.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Meanwhile, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/melanie-martinez-aria-albums-chart-1235299432/"  >in Australia</a>, “Flower” plants itself at No. 33 on the ARIA Chart. She’s the third member of the group to crack the ARIA Top 50, following recordings by Rosé and Lisa.<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The colossal hit rewrites Mary J. Blige’s mark from 2006 and ties for fourth place on the overall count.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/sza/"  >SZA</a>’s “Kill Bill” achieves one of the biggest honors ever on <em>Billboard</em>’s <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/r-b-hip-hop-songs/"  >Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> chart, as the track breaks the record for the most weeks at No. 1 by a lead female artist in the list’s nearly 65-year history. The single cements the feat with its 16th week on top, passing Mary J. Blige’s “Be Without You,” which captured 15 weeks at the summit in 2006.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The “Kill Bill” coronation comes on the April 15-dated Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, which factors streaming, radio airplay and sales into its methodology. For the corresponding tracking week of March 31-April 6, “Kill Bill” earned 23.4 million official U.S. streams, according to Luminate, a 5% dip from the prior week. Despite the decline, the single logs a 15th nonconsecutive week at No. 1 on the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/r-and-b-hip-hop-streaming-songs/"  >R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs</a> chart. The song sold 6,000 downloads in the week (up 158%, helped by 69-cent sale-pricing in the iTunes Store), prompting a 3-1 jump for its first week atop the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/r-and-b-hip-hop-digital-song-sales/"  >R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales</a> chart. In the radio world, “Kill Bill” registered 93 million in total airplay audience for the week, essentially even week-over-week. (All airplay, regardless of radio format origin, contributes to a title’s rank on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs.)</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	As mentioned, a 16th week atop Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs gives “Kill Bill” sole possession of the record for the most weeks at No. 1 for a song by a woman in a lead role. It breaks from a tie, set last week, with Mary J. Blige’s “Be Without You,” which ruled for 15 weeks in 2006. Now that “Kill Bill” has defeated all such competitors, here’s a look at the longest-running No. 1s by women in lead roles, since the chart became an all-encompassing genre survey in 1958.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<span style="text-decoration: underline">Weeks at No. 1, Song Title, Artist, Date Reached No. 1:</span><br>16, “Kill Bill,” SZA, Dec. 24, 2022<br>15, “Be Without You,” Mary J. Blige, Jan. 7, 2006<br>14, “Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here,” Deborah Cox, Nov. 7, 1998<br>14, “We Belong Together,” Mariah Carey, June 4, 2005<br>14, “Diamonds,” Rihanna, Oct. 20, 2012<br>13, “Fancy,” Iggy Azalea featuring Charli XCX, June 7, 2014<br>12, “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” Beyoncé, Nov. 29, 2008<br>12, “Un-Thinkable (I’m Ready),” Alicia Keys, May 22, 2010</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Including featured artists, British singer <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/kyla/"  >Kyla</a> owns the all-time mark among women. She, with Wizkid, guested on Drake’s smash “One Dance,” an 18-week champ in 2016.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="embed-youtube"><iframe loading="lazy" title="SZA - Kill Bill (Official Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSRcC626prw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On the overall scorecard, “Kill Bill” sits in the top five of the longest-leading Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop champs since 1958. A 16th leading week ties it with Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines,” featuring Pharrell and T.I., for fourth place. The pair places behind, in order, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus (20 weeks, 2019) and Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow’s “Industry Baby” (18 weeks, 2021-22) and the aforementioned “One Dance” (18). As “Kill Bill” has ranked at No. 1 for 16 of its 17 weeks on the chart since its debut last December, the song could likely challenge for the all-time title in just over a month&#8217;s time.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Kill Bill” is SZA’s second career No. 1 on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, after “I Hate U” debuted at the summit and led for a week in December 2021. Both tracks appear on her latest album, <em>SOS</em> – itself a juggernaut in the genre. The album has posted 16 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/r-b-hip-hop-albums/"  >Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums</a> chart since it debuted in the top slot last December.</p>
