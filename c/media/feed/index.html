<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	HYBE is gearing up to launch a brand new girl group, and Billboard&#8217;s Tetris Kelly sat down with the South Korean entertainment company&#8217;s Executive Creator Son Sung Deuk about what fans can expect.<br>While the process of building the girl group is still underway, Son Sung Deuk says that he and his team &#8220;really are working and studying hard to create the sound and the content that people around the globe can love. We&#8217;ll see what it&#8217;ll look like, but we&#8217;re working hard to create content that fans around the world will really enjoy.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	He adds that their plans for the upcoming launch is still &#8220;very open,&#8221; but HYBE is hoping to create content that resonates with today&#8217;s music lovers. &#8220;No matter what that looks like, I guarantee that our content and artists will exceed all your expectations,&#8221; the executive reveals.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	One of the biggest groups Son Sung Deuk works with is BTS, who he&#8217;s teamed up with since before their debut. &#8220;Working with them from before debut to recently was very important to me and an amazing challenge for my career, and the results and the whole experience were incredible,&#8221; he shares. &#8220;I was always so happy and the work was always fun, and it was an amazing opportunity to be loved by so many people and grow as a person. It was often fun and challenging at the same time, but at the end of the day it was a joy because there was so much that people could love.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	He also gave insight into his favorite of BTS&#8217; many jaw-dropping performances, though he admits that it&#8217;s hard to choose as he&#8217;s &#8220;put everything I have into every one of them.&#8221; The executive pointed out the group&#8217;s 2021 United Nations performance and 2022 Grammys performance as &#8220;really impactful and most memorable for me.&#8221;</p>
