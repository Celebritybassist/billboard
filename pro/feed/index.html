					<description><![CDATA[Its 47-week trek to the summit marks a new record.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Singer-songwriter and producer <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/fred-jerkins/"  >Fred Jerkins</a>’ “I Believe,” featuring Bishop Paul S. Morton, reaches No. 1 on <em>Billboard</em>’s <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/gospel-airplay/"  >Gospel Airplay</a> chart (dated April 15).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The song, Jerkins’ third Gospel Airplay leader and Morton’s first, increased by 1% in plays March 31-April 6, according to Luminate.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The song was solely written and produced by Jerkins, who hails from Galloway, N.J.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“It feels so amazing to have achieved my third No. 1 as an artist on <em>Billboard</em>&#8216;s chart,” says Jerkins. “Also, being able to share this with a legend like Bishop Paul Morton makes it extra special for me.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Jerkins previously topped Gospel Airplay with “Patiently Praising,” for a week in January 2021, and “Victory,” featuring Last Call, for two frames in April 2019.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Morton’s first Gospel Airplay leader is among 11 appearances, starting in 2005. His lone additional top 10 is “Your Best Days Yet,” which reached No. 4 in 2013. (Also among his history on the chart: “Seasons Change,” with legend Aretha Franklin, hit No. 40 in 2005.)</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In addition to his career in music, Morton is the founding bishop of Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship International in Atlanta, as well as overseer of Greater St. Stephen Ministries in New Orleans.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Notably, with “I Believe” reaching the Gospel Airplay pinnacle in its 47th week, it completes the longest trip to No. 1 since the chart started in March 2005. It passes two songs that each took 46 weeks to the top: Jonathan McReynolds’ “Make Room” led for a week in December 2019 and Donnie McClurkin’s “I Need You” reigned for a week in April 2017.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>Maher’s Fourth Leader</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On <em>Billboard</em>’s Christian AC Airplay chart, Matt Maher scores his fourth No. 1 with “The Lord’s Prayer” (up 9% in plays).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Maher previously ruled with “Alive &amp; Breathing,” featuring Elle Limebear, for two weeks in July 2020; “Glory (Let There Be Peace),” for a week in January 2017; and “Because He Lives (Amen),” for four frames beginning in April 2015.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In this week's Legal Beat, Mötley Crüe's guitarist sues the band, Kanye faces a lawsuit over Donda Academy, Steven Tyler denies abuse claims and much more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>This is </em>The Legal Beat,<em> a weekly newsletter about music law from Billboard Pro, offering you a one-stop cheat sheet of big new cases, important rulings and all the fun stuff in between.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>This week: Mötley Crüe faces a lawsuit claiming the band unceremoniously terminated its longtime guitarist; <em>Kanye West’s Donda Academy is hit with a wrongful termination suit packed with bizarre details</em>; Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler responds to a sexual abuse case; and much more.</em></p>



	<h2 class="heading larva //   a-font-primary-bold-xl   "><strong>THE BIG STORY: </strong>Mötley Crüe Heads To Court</h2>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	A private feud between longtime members of the legendary rock band <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/motley-crue/"  >Mötley Crüe</a> has burst into public view.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Crüe co-founder Mick Mars filed a lawsuit last week demanding access to the band’s books &#8212; and thus also disclosing for the first time that he and his former bandmates have been locked in private arbitration proceedings for months over the legal mechanics of his exit from the band.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	According to Mars, his former “brothers” tossed him to the curb after he said he could no longer tour due to a “tragic” disability called ankylosing spondylitis. The rest of Crüe, on the other hand, says they offered Mars “generous compensation” as a courtesy, but that he instead chose to file an “ugly public lawsuit.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The case is technically about dry issues like LLC operating agreements. Mars says the band did not have cause to terminate his 25% stake in Crüe’s corporate entities; the band says they all signed an agreement in 2008 that clearly states they owe Mars nothing after he resigned. But each side has also already made much splashier allegations, too. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In his complaint, Mars claimed that Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx “did not play a single note” during a recent tour, and instead essentially mimed along to recorded tracks. In response, the band released sworn statements from touring staffers claiming that it was Mars who had needed backing tracks during concerts: &#8220;There were times when he played a completely different song than the rest of the band. This happened at almost every show.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	For a full breakdown of the case against Crüe &#8212; including access to the actual complaint Mars filed against the band &#8212; <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/motley-crue-guitarist-mick-mars-lawsuit-band-finances-firing/"  >go read the entire story here</a>.</p>



	<h2 class="heading larva //   a-font-primary-bold-xl   ">Other top stories…</h2>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>TROUBLE AT SCHOOL</strong> &#8211; Two former teachers at <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/kanye-west/"  >Kanye West</a>’s Donda Academy <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/kanye-west-sued-donda-academy-teachers-wrongful-termination/"  >filed a lawsuit against the embattled star</a>, alleging wrongful termination, discrimination and unpaid wages. The allegations included bizarre details about West’s controversial school, including that students were fed only sushi and that classes were restricted to the ground floor because West is afraid of stairs.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>ROCHESTER CONCERT TRAGEDY </strong>&#8211; Ronisha Huston, an alleged victim of last month’s deadly stampede at a GloRilla concert in western New York, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/rochester-stampede-victim-lawsuit-glorilla-concert/"  >filed notice that she was formally preparing to sue</a> over the incident. Saying she had suffered emotional distress, Huston’s lawyers need “pre-action discovery” to obtain video footage, emergency plans and other key information from the concert venue.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>STEVEN TYLER DENIES ABUSE CLAIMS</strong> &#8211; The <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/aerosmith/"  >Aerosmith</a> singer <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/steven-tyler-sex-assault-denial-accuser-response/"  >denied allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman</a> named Julia Holcomb when she was a minor in the 1970s. The filing raised eyebrows because Tyler’s lawyers argued, among many possible defenses, that Holcomb had possibly consented to his conduct, or that he was immunized from her claims since he had been granted legal custody over her.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>TRADEMARK ON A MANTRA? </strong>Insomniac Events, a major promoter of dance music events, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/insomniac-events-plur-trademark/"  >made waves this week</a> when fans noticed that it had recently filed an application to secure a federal trademark registration on the term “PLUR” &#8212; an acronym (peace, love, unity, respect) that has been heavily used in the dance scene since the early ‘90s.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>LOVERS &amp; FRIENDS LAWSUIT</strong> &#8211; Live Nation was <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/live-nation-sued-lovers-friends-festival-stampede-las-vegas/"  >hit with a lawsuit</a> over injuries at last year’s Lovers &amp; Friends festival during a stampede triggered by false reports of gunfire. The three fans who filed the case say the concert giant “failed to take basic, reasonable steps” to protect them from such an incident: “Plaintiffs screamed for emergency medical care for their injuries, but none came.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>PANDORA CLAIMS TOSSED</strong> &#8211; For a second and final time, a California federal judge <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/pandora-lawsuit-comedians-thrown-out-judge/"  >rejected Pandora’s allegations</a> that comedians have been illegally conspiring to extract unfair prices from the digital streaming service. Those accusations came as counterclaims after the comics sued Pandora, demanding to be paid the spoken-word equivalent of publishing royalties for their underlying jokes.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>POP SMOKE KILLER SENTENCED</strong> &#8211; One of four men charged in the killing of rapper <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/pop-smoke/"  >Pop Smoke</a> during a robbery at a Hollywood Hills mansion <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/pop-smoke-murder-man-pleads-guilty-robbery-killing-1235299470/"  >pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter</a>. The man, whose name has not been released because he was a minor when the killing occurred in early 2020, was sentenced to four years and two months in a juvenile facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Live Nation is facing a lawsuit from three people who say they were injured at last year’s Lovers &amp; Friends Music Festival in Las Vegas, during a stampede triggered by false reports of gunfire.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In a complaint filed last week in Los Angeles, plaintiffs <strong>Carla Thomas</strong>, <strong>James Thomas</strong> and <strong>Aaliyah Aguilar</strong> claimed that Live Nation had “failed to take basic, reasonable steps” to protect them from such an incident.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Plaintiffs screamed for help from the event organizers and security, but none came,” attorneys for the trio wrote in the April 4 lawsuit. “Plaintiffs screamed for emergency medical care for their injuries, but none came.”</p>

	The two-day Lovers &amp; Friends festival, held over a weekend last May, featured several R&amp;B and rap artists, including Usher, Ludacris and Ne-Yo. But performances were briefly halted that Saturday when <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lovers-friends-festival-las-vegas-crowds-rush-exit-1235071099/"  >a large group of panicked attendees fled the venue</a> over rumors of gun shots. Police later said that there was no evidence that a shooting took place.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Stampedes amid false reports of gunfire have cropped up several times in recent years. Fans suffered injuries during gunfire panics at a Future concert in Brooklyn in 2017, at Lil Wayne and Cardi B concerts in 2018, and at the 2019 Rolling Loud festival in Miami. Just last month, three fans were killed during a stampede at a GloRilla concert in western New York reportedly sparked by fears of a shooter.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In their lawsuit, Thomas, Thomas and Aguilar claimed that the rush at Lovers &amp; Friends was triggered by a “loud noise,” causing a “sea of people” to surge toward them. They said they were “pushed, smashed, dragged, kicked, stepped on, trampled and crushed to the ground” during the incident, causing them “serious injuries” and emotional distress.</p>

	“Defendants failed to employ adequate, properly trained, monitored, and supervised reasonable security, safety and medical provision measures,” they wrote. “Defendants failed to provide a safe venue, one that provided adequate signs and warnings that would have guided the crowd into a particular emergency exit route in the event of an alarm or emergency.”</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The authors of a new report that paints a dismal portrait of gender diversity in recording studios are calling on major labels to step up their efforts to hire more women producers and engineers.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Published by Fix the Mix &#8212; an initiative launched in 2022 by nonprofit We Are Moving the Needle and official music credits database Jaxsta &#8212; the first annual report, created in conjunction with Middle Tennessee State University and Howard University and released Tuesday (April 11), found that women and non-binary people are drastically underrepresented in audio producing and engineering roles in recording studios.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Analyzing 1,128 songs from 2022, the report (<em>Lost In The Mix: An Analysis of Credited Technical Professionals in the Music Industry Highlighting Women and Non-Binary Producers and Engineers Across DSP Playlists, Genres, Awards, and Record Certifications</em>) found that only 16 of the 240 credited producers and engineers (6.7%) on the top 10 most-streamed tracks of 2022 across five major digital service providers (Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube and TikTok) were women and non-binary people.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The levels of representation varied across genres. Among the top 50 songs across 14 genres examined in the report, metal had the lowest percentage of women and non-binary people credited in key technical roles at 0.0%, with rap and Christian &amp; gospel coming in at 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. On the other end of the spectrum, electronic stands out for its relatively high representation of women and non-binary people in producer roles, accounting for 17.6% of all producer credits on the top 50 songs of 2022, while folk &amp; Americana was close behind at 16.4%.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“While this research notes the genres that have the best and worst gender representations, it is important to note that every genre needs improvement in representation of women and non-binary people,” said report co-author <strong>Beverly Keel</strong>, dean of Middle Tennessee State University’s College of Media and Entertainment, co-founder of Change the Conversation and co-founder of Nashville Music Equality. “It is difficult to fathom that representation remains so pitifully low in 2023. In any other industry, these low percentages of the genres that have the best gender representation would be an embarrassment, so I hope these ‘high achievers’ are not resting on their laurels.”</p>

	Analyzing data from streaming services that report assistant credits, the report also found that women and non-binary people are better represented in assistant roles, which have 12.6% percentage points more women and non-binary people on average than key technical roles. The report suggests that, “while this higher concentration of women and non-binary people in assistant roles may indicate a growing pipeline of these contributors rising into key levels, it could be indicative of a glass ceiling preventing this demographic from an upward trajectory.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	This year’s Grammy Award nominees didn&#8217;t fare well in terms of representation either. Of all winning albums in the 28 “best in genre” categories in 2023, 17 credited zero women or non-binary people in the key technical roles of producer and engineer. A total of eight projects listed women and non-binary people as producers (representing 11.5% of all producers) and three projects listed women and non-binary people as engineers (representing 3.9% of all engineers). The total number of women and non-binary people credited in technical roles was 19 out of 249, or just 7.6%. Across the eight Grammy Award categories that honored people in technical roles, only one woman was recognized versus 30 men.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	To offer a wider look at the music industry, the report also analyzed the RIAA diamond-certified list (songs that have achieved 10-times-platinum status) and the Spotify &#8220;Billions Club&#8221; (songs that have received 1 billion streams on the streaming platform). Of the top 50 songs on the RIAA diamond-certified list, there are a total of 248 key technical roles credited. Of those, 224 (98.4%) are filled by men while just 4 (1.6%) are filled by women or non-binary people. Of the four women and non-binary individuals credited, three are producers (two of which were the main artist on the track), while one is an engineer. Among the top 50 songs included on Spotify’s Billions Club, women and non-binary people make up only 2% of key technical roles.</p>

	The new report acknowledges that its numbers differ from the “pioneering” research conducted annually by the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/annenberg-inclusion-initiative-2022-music-report/"  >USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative</a>, which found that only 2.8% of music industry producers were women in 2022. The Annenberg study uses the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts as a measuring stick, while the Fix the Mix report looked at 757 top-streamed songs, 30 Grammy-winning albums, the top 50 songs on the Spotify Billions Playlist, and the top 50 songs certified diamond by the RIAA.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Ensuring that there is more gender and racial diversity among music’s creators is not actually a complex problem if you want to solve it,” said co-author <strong>Emily Lazar</strong>, Grammy Award-winning mastering engineer and founder of We Are Moving The Needle. “The most important step is for artists and record labels to be able to hire from a more diverse pool of producers, mixers and engineers, but it’s exceedingly hard to hire people when you can’t find them. We hope this report will give decision makers the motivation and tools they need to make real change in their hiring practices so we can achieve gender parity in production, engineering and mastering roles.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The report finishes with a list of recommendations and solutions to address the gender gap, including accurately crediting all technical contributors, diversifying hiring practices, educating the industry, finding and hiring women and non-binary producers and engineers, demanding data transparency, amplifying representation and encouraging active participation, supporting the changemakers and developing forward-facing solutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Singapore subsidiary of Nodwin has acquired a 51% stake in Branded, the full-service live media specialist.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Branded, the parent and organizer of Asia’s annual All That Matters conference and showcase event, is now part of the <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://nodwingaming.com/"  target="_blank"  >Nodwin Gaming</a> family.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Announced Tuesday (April 11), the Singapore subsidiary of Nodwin has acquired a 51% stake in Branded, the full-service live media specialist.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Financial terms weren’t disclosed.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	As part of the arrangement, Nodwin, part of Nazara Technologies, will acquire all Branded’s existing event IPs, including All That Matters. Also, Nodwin, one of the world’s leading gaming and esports companies, will “expand its network of international sponsors to grow revenues from its live business as it continues its pursuit to grow as a sports media company” with a focus on esports and gaming, reads a statement unveiling the acquisition.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Branded co-founder and CEO Jasper Donat says both parties will tap into business synergies across APAC and beyond, with a view to expanding on its existing events and IP, and co-creating new properties.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Over the past few years, Branded has transformed from a live event IP creator and producer to a live media company,” he comments. “We are really excited to become a part of the Nodwin Gaming family and share their vision and commitment to the business of growing media and entertainment and the communities around them.&#8221;</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Based in Singapore, Branded produces All That Matters, which includes the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/music-matters-2022-5-takeaways-singapore-asia-market/"  >Music Matters stream</a> and complementary tracks on live entertainment, sponsorship, sports and more. ATM is widely considered the most important music conference in the region, with more than 2,000 guests turning up in a regular year, <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://events.bizzabo.com/atm2023/"  target="_blank"  >organizers say</a>. The 2022 program featured <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/music-matters-2022-5-takeaways-singapore-asia-market/"  >guest speakers</a> Universal Music Group <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/all-that-matters-singapore-executives-tiktok-inside-track/"  >Lucian Grainge</a>; Spotify’s global head of editorial <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://themusicnetwork.com/spotify-sulinna-ong-interview/"  target="_blank"  >Sulinna Ong</a>; TikTok’s global head of music <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://themusicnetwork.com/tiktok-ole-obermann-interview/"  target="_blank"  >Ole Obermann</a>; and <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://themusicnetwork.com/aeg-adam-wilkes-titan-michael-gudinski/"  target="_blank"  >Adam Wilkes</a>, president, AEG Presents Asia Pacific, among others.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“We share very similar synergies be it our common love for gaming, sports, music, esports or entertainment, so this was a near-perfect match,” says Nodwin co-founder and CEO Akshat Rathee, noting Branded’s IP “will add a new dimension to what we already offer.” </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On the flip side, Rathee explains, we “will also look at the talented Branded team taking our existing IPs such as Playground, The Premiership, NH7 and others international.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	This year’s ATM celebrates its &#8220;coming of age&#8221; 18th edition with a three-day-long industry powwow at Hilton Orchard, which, again, revs up for the Singapore F1 <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/all-that-matters-conference-joins-singapore-grand-prix-6777874/"  >Grand Prix week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pmc-paywall">












<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	For the second time, a California federal<strong> </strong>judge has rejected Pandora’s countersuit allegations that comedians were illegally teaming up&nbsp;to reach a more lucrative royalty deal with the digital streaming service&nbsp;in violation of antitrust law.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The antitrust issues were part of a counterclaim brought by Pandora in its defense against copyright infringement claims<strong> </strong>from several living and late comedians or their companies, estates and families, including <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/george-carlin/"  >George Carlin</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/robin-williams/"  >Robin Williams</a>, Nick Di Paolo, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/lewis-black/"  >Lewis Black</a>, Bill Engvall, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ron-white/"  >Ron White</a>, Bill Hicks and Andrew Dice Clay.</p>

	Those comedians <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/pandora-comedy-copyright-lawsuits-robin-williams/"  >filed a copyright infringement suit against Pandora</a> in February 2022, claiming the digital service is only paying royalties on the comedians’ recordings, but not the underlying literary works that fueled the recordings &#8212; i.e., the jokes.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	But Pandora <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/pandora-responds-comedians-streaming-copyrights/"  >filed a countersuit&nbsp;that May</a>,&nbsp;naming the comedians and two organizations that license and collect royalties on behalf of comedians&nbsp;— Word Collections and Spoken Giants — as defendants. The countersuit said the&nbsp;defendants&nbsp;collectively represented a monopoly that was conspiring for higher royalty payments.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	At the end of October, Judge<strong> Mark Scarsi </strong><a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/pandora-comedy-copyright-lawsuit-royalties-word-collections/"  >rejected Pandora’s antitrust arguments</a> but left the digital music service provider the ability to amend the complaint, which it did. Scarsi, for the second time, on Wednesday (April 5), rejected the amended antitrust arguments in their entirety and this time blocked further amendments, leaving the proceedings to center on the original copyright infringement claims.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On the other hand, Scarsi ruled that Spoken Giants and Word Collections did not make a persuasive case that sanctions are warranted against Pandora, concluding that Pandora had standing to bring its amended counterclaims and did so in a “good faith, if ultimately meritless, basis for the filing. So [the defendants&#8217;] motion for sanctions against Pandora are denied,” Scarsi concluded.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In response to Scarsi&#8217;s order dismissing Pandora’s counterclaims, <strong>Richard Busch</strong>, who represented the comedians as plaintiffs in the original infringement lawsuit and as defendants in Pandora’s counterclaim suit, issued a statement. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“These legendary comedians filed legitimate copyright infringement claims. Rather than defend against them on the merits, Pandora and its lawyers decided to file antitrust claims that we believe were clearly meant to intimidate my clients and their families, and put Word Collections out of business,&#8221; said Busch. &#8220;It didn’t work. Even when the judge dismissed Pandora’s claims the first time and told them that he was skeptical that they could plead valid claims, they were undeterred and brazenly pressed forward with a new complaint that we believed was just as bad if not worse than the first one. The court has now agreed, and has rightfully dismissed Pandora’s claims, again, this time with prejudice and specifically and explicitly without any right to try again. We now look forward to pursuing the infringement claims as should have been the case from the beginning.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Pandora parent company SiriusXM did not respond to an email request for comment.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	From 2021 to 2022, Matsuura estimates she oversaw 750 catalog valuations totaling $15.5 billion for clients such as <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/merck-mercuriadis-hipgnosis-billboard-cover-story-interview-2021/"  >Hipgnosis Songs Fund</a>, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/features/whitney-houston-estate-legacy-primary-wave-1235165011/"  >Primary Wave</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/reservoir-q3-earnings-revenues-up-16-percent-music-publishing/"  >Reservoir Media</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	But as billions have flooded the music intellectual property market, the practice of valuing catalogs has encountered unexpected controversy, with Massarsky and Matsuura’s team occasionally in the middle. Banks put considerable weight on catalog valuations when determining how much to lend to a buyer, and some question whether Citrin Cooperman’s discount rate — which has not budged since spring 2022 — ignores macroeconomic pressures, such as the rising cost to borrow, that could affect valuations. Lower valuations could lead banks to decrease the amounts they lend overall, which could have a cooling effect on the market. “The reason we did not increase our discount rate along with the rising interest rate environment is because we had originally started at a higher discount rate so that we could accommodate for that rise,” Matsuura says. “We knew that this low interest rate environment was not sustainable in the long term.”</p>

	Matsuura says she’s confident that she and her team are “doing a credible and responsible job.” Her solemn, studious demeanor suggests that she is unruffled by the pressures of her work — perhaps the byproduct of her past as a concert pianist. Matsuura attended The Juilliard School in Manhattan from the age of 15 and spent her 20s performing concerts and solo chamber music across North America and Asia before pivoting to the financial side of the industry she loved. “There was something about quantifying the abstract — the future — that appealed to me,” she says.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	After graduating from Cornell University’s SC&nbsp;Johnson College of Business in 2001, fellow Cornell alumnus Massarsky recruited Matsuura to join what was then the one-man firm of Massarsky Consulting. The two sold the firm to Citrin Cooperman in 2022 and are now growing its team of analysts to accommodate the increasing demand for their services.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“There were many early signals that valuation would become an important expertise in this industry,” Matsuura says. “Clients were already asking us to do valuations of smaller assets such as music libraries. We did not know at the time that the investment market would become so big.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>Why is independence so important to your job?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Our job is to provide the market value of a catalog or portfolio of catalogs, and being independent is critical to achieving that. Capital is raised based on the values of these assets, and there needs to be confidence that the valuation was arrived at independently in order to do so. A few of the ways in which we achieve that independence are one, being consistent in our methodology across all of the funds, including the application of growth rates, and two, solving for the market value, not for an individual fund’s purchasing ability based on their hurdle rate [the individual investor’s rate of return].</p>

	<strong>What factors do you consider when valuing a catalog?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Our job is to determine the market value of a given music catalog using different inputs that go into a valuation model. One of them is the discount rate, but the majority of inputs that go into developing the model are actually growth rates. How the music industry is performing across different income streams — and it’s performing very strongly — is another consideration.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>What role does the discount rate play in the process?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	From a discounted cash-flow perspective, future cash flows are discounted to the present value. The present value represents the value of the catalog. The discount rate represents the return on your investment, essentially.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>How do you calculate the discount rate?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The essential method is the weighted average cost of capital, [about] which we’ve refined our thinking over time. We factor in an equity-risk premium, a beta [the measure of an asset’s volatility in relation to the overall stock market] of 0.65%. So, what would the risk-free rate — which is probably best represented by the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond — need to be to potentially raise or change the discount rate of 8.5%? Our view based on the numbers is that there is still margin before a change can be considered.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>How much margin?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	I’ve described some of the inputs, but they aren’t fixed in stone. That’s one reason why it’s difficult to say, “This is the number.” There are two schools of thought on when to change the discount rate. The first is if the risk-free rate is high enough to suggest that that margin has been eroded. The other school of thought is that you should change the discount rate not based on small fluctuations in the risk-free rate or fluctuations in where it will peak, but rather based on where it will eventually land in the long term. We’re talking about a long-lived asset.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>When you say “long term,” what kind of time period do you have in mind?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	We do a 15-year projection, but the actual asset is 95 years after the death of the composer. Thinking about where this rate is going to land in the long term makes more sense [for calculating] the discount rate. The question is how and when to make that determination — that crystal ball. We are attentive to the risk-free rate and to the possibility of changing that rate. But it would be hard to be beholden to an exact number.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>What debt-to-equity&nbsp;profiles do you consider in your ­calculations?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Our mandate is really to solve for the market and, to the best of our ability, come up with the market value of an asset. We can’t take into account the capital structure or debt-to-equity profile of any given acquirer because that would just be solving for their purchase price, and that wouldn’t necessarily represent market value. So we use a 50-50 ratio to represent an overall industry capital structure ratio in our valuations. And we use that repeatedly.</p>

	<strong>What are you seeing in terms of multiples? From <em>Billboard</em>’s estimates, it appears that superstar catalogs these days get around 20 times-plus multiples, while most others fall below that.</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Multiples are tricky, and should not be used to price a catalog. There are always unique aspects to each catalog that can’t be captured in a multiple. Standards catalogs — older catalogs — are getting on average 20-plus multiples because they have stood the test of time.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	I don’t know that I have observed bias. What I can definitely say is that all of the funds have excellent investment teams that conduct thorough due diligence and carefully develop their own models. What I can also observe is that transactions are taking place across a wider range of genres compared [with], say, five years ago. Investors are open to investing in many different types of music. Although this may be a result of more competitors in the market, which has led to exploring more thoroughly all the different types of music that can be potentially acquired.</p>

	<strong>How much does success on TikTok affect a catalog’s value? How do you forecast royalties from that kind&nbsp;of source?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	TikTok can impact the value of a catalog in different ways. It may raise the overall value on a long-term basis — for example, the effect of [<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/viral-dreams-tiktok-timeline-9465600/"  >viral videos featuring</a>] “Dreams” on Fleetwood Mac’s catalog — or it may have a more temporary effect. The way we forecast royalties from TikTok is by using comps — that is, TikTok spikes from similar titles and artists — and we’ll also consider whether there may be momentum following the spike that could generate additional value to the song or even catalog.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<strong>If Spotify raises its subscription price later this year in the current inflationary market, how would that affect the economics for digital service providers and rights holders?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Music is a relatively price-inelastic product whose business model essentially reversed itself, from a CD model of $18 for 18 tracks, or $1 per track, to the streaming model — which, at $10 per month for unlimited listening of an unlimited number of tracks, is effectively a marginal cost of zero for each additional track. This is so reasonable that consumers are less price sensitive to it than other goods, and an increase in the subscription price should for the most part lead directly to additional revenue for the DSPs and rights holders.</p>

	Chilean singer-songwriter <strong>Polimá Westcoast </strong>signed a global deal with Sony Music U.S. Latin,<em> Billboard</em> has learned. With this agreement, the up-and-coming artist expands his relationship with the label after previously singing with Sony Music Entertainment Chile in 2019.  </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Born Polimá Ngangu Eduardo Miguel Orellana, the Santiago-born act entered the music industry in 2018 with his edgy “Trap Star,&#8221; which captured his trap star-meets-rock star attitude. Polimá Westcoast gradually made a name for himself as a local artist performing at the important Lollapalooza Chile Festival last year and at Viña del Mar International Song Festival in February. </p>

	&#8220;This is something fundamental for me that not only I worked on, but also along my great team,&#8221; the singer said in a statement. &#8220;A lot is happening with my career at the international stage. We are ready and determined to take the necessary steps to achieve the next level.&#8221;</p>

	Although Polimá has been making music for some time now, it was his Pailita-assisted track “Ultra Solo” released last year that really put him on the map. It peaked at No. 9 on the <a  rel="noreferrer noopener"  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-global-excl-us/"  target="_blank"  >Billboard Excl. U.S.</a> chart (dated July 2, 2022). He later landed a remix alongside Paloma Mami, <a  rel="noreferrer noopener"  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/feid/"  target="_blank"  >Feid</a> and De La Ghetto. In the past, he&#8217;s also collaborated with <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/j-balvin/"  >J Balvin</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/quevedo/"  >Quevedo</a>. </p>

	&#8220;We are very happy to continue working with Polimá Westcoast, who has proven to be one of the most talented and creative artists of his generation,&#8221; added <strong>Alex Gallardo</strong>, president of Sony Music U.S. Latin. &#8220;We are confident that together we can bring his music to new audiences worldwide. Today, we welcome him to Sony U.S. Latin, where we are committed to helping him continue to grow his name internationally and become one of the biggest names in Latin music.&#8221;</p>
